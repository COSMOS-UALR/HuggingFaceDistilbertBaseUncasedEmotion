forces after going on the rampage amid ukraine s current turmoil  muzychko s death followed many years of unpunished militant activity in neo nazi organizations  according to russia s investigative committee  in         muzychko tortured and killed at least    captive servicemen  breaking officers  fingers  poking their eyes out and cutting the throats of some of his victims ukrainian radical nationalist leader aleksandr muzychko went on with the rampage against regional authorities  lashing out at a local prosecutor with obscene language  punches and threats  the radical claimed the prosecutors were  sabotaging  their job  muzychko  who is a member of the right sector radical movement  arrived at rovno  rivne  oblast prosecutor s office after he heard claims that a criminal investigation into a local murder is being delayed  the controversial  activist   known for taking part in the chechen conflict against russian troops  for his recent kalashnikov brandishing in front of regional authorities and for making openly anti semitic statements  decided to take the matter into his own hands  without going into detail  muzychko grasped a procedural prosecutor he found present at the workplace  nearly strangling the clerk with his own tie and shouting at him in dirty language  the prosecutor asked to be given a chance to explain the situation  but the heated radical did not want to hear any explanations   shut the f  k up  you b tch  your f  king time is over   he uttered  threatening to rope the clerk like a dog and lead him to the people on maidan  muzychko was furious to learn the regional prosecutor was not at his workplace because he was  in hospital   calling the prosecutors useless  chairwarmers   he accused them of deliberately shirking their job   does it mean i have to elect my own prosecutor  if these animals do not want to work  what is this  a sabotage  should we have mayhem  anarchy in the country  they will keep sitting here and covering  the criminals    the clerk tried to intervene in the radical s speech  but received a slap on the face   if you think i am goodie because i ve come without my rifle  you are gravely mistaken  i ve come with a pistol  work   local paper rivnepost rv ua also quoted some of muzychko s words that were not caught on film  according to the paper  the radical threatened that otherwise he will have the clerk lynched by an angry mob  the confused prosecutor later explained the situation to journalists  saying that muzychko has probably been  misinformed   according to the clerk  the suspected murderer of the local woman in question has been kept in detention without any formal charges placed on him only because the investigation was in progress  now that the police have found some evidence  the charges will be brought against the man  meanwhile  the new ukrainian authorities cast a blind eye on extremist actions of the armed right sector apparently in return for the group s active help in overthrowing the government of ousted president yanukovich  since the start of the turmoil in ukraine  atrocities committed by the ukrainian radicals have been routinely dismissed by coup d  tat supporters as  propaganda  and mostly ignored by the western media  however  with people like muzychko appearing on youtube  it is becoming increasingly difficult for the new authorities to veil the situation in the country as  peaceful protests    opposition intimidating techniques       ukraine neo nazi criminal state looming in the centre of europe comment page    after signing a void agreement on  crisis settlement  on friday  the situation in the ukraine has rapidly got out of control of its signatories and  witnesses   no provisions of this document were fulfilled  the legitimate authorities fled  or tried to flee  the country  the governmental buildings in kiev are taken by the revolutionary mob  the radicals are dictating the new rules to fa ade opposition  leaders  who desperately try to bridle the maidan  what happened to the ukraine on february          is essentially a criminal coup committed by the radical armed anarchists and ukrainian nazis who have been enjoying a comprehensive financial  military  diplomatic and even religious support and instigation from the western power groups for the last two decades  many of the ukraine s cities are now falling into the chaos of lootings  unprovoked violence  lynch law and political repressions  the first signs of upcoming chaos were clearly seen as the ukrainian authorities wavered at the three month siege of the centre of kiev by the radical guerrilla elements from galicia and local criminal gangs  they watched silently when furious fanatics were burning unarmed riot police berkut officers alive  lynching them and pulling out their eyes  they did nothing to stop frantic  freedom fighters  from storming regional administrations  humiliating the officials and looting police and military arsenals in the west ukraine  they were paralyzed when unidentified snipers were cool bloodily killing militia personnel  protesters and casual passers by from the roofs of kiev s buildings  they even declared amnesty  twice   to those guilty of the brutal crimes against policemen and public order  thus yanukovych s regime itself paved the way for a sinister ghost of the war torn libya to come to ukraine  is the guerrilla side a self organized and self indoctrinated popular movement tired of a corrupt and inefficient state  that is hardly the case  since the collapse of the soviet union the international power groups have invested billions of the federal reserve notes  aka us   into ukrainian  pro democratic  ngos and politicians  while preaching  ukrainian commitment to the european choice and democratic values  in the meantime they clearly saw that there was no short term historical perspective for making ukraine a state hostile to russia  which is evidently the final goal of the globalist eastern policy  the stakes were placed on the ultranationalist elements in the western ukraine and in the uniate church  a minority religious greek catholic community of the eastern rite  created by the holy see in xvi century in a desperate attempt to weaken close ties of rzeczpospolita s orthodox with moscow  since the early     s the uniates enjoyed silent support of the newly independent central authorities in kiev  their tactic was to aggressively occupy orthodox cathedrals on the canonic territory of the moscow patriarchate  the last thing the uniate clergy used to preach in the occupied churches for all these years was the christian call for repentance and peace  instead they propagated a new crusade against the orthodox and directly instigated and justified race motivated prosecutions and even killings  acting exactly like radical jihadist preachers of the militant pseudo islamic sects  suffice to watch a  sunday sermon  by mykhailo arsenych  the clergyman from a local uniate church in ivano frankovsk region  ukraine saying   today we are really ready for a revolution the only effective methods of combat are assassination and terror  we want to be sure that no chinese  negro  jew or muscovite will try to come and grab our land tomorrow   the products of such indoctrination were not long in coming  a number of nato sponsored training centers for the ukrainian ultranationalist militants were opened on the territory of the baltic states immediately after they joined nato in       the detailed photo report on a ukrainian group taking a course of subversive activities at a nato training center in estonia in      is available here  texts in russian   abundant financial and human resources were directed to bolster the paramilitary units of the radical una unso  svoboda and other ultranationalist organizations in the ukraine  since     s these thugs were participating in the chechen and balkan wars on the side of radical wahhabi     militants and committing war crimes against captured russian and serbian soldiers and civilian population  one of the notorious guerilla fighters of the ukrainian origin in chechnya  olexander muzychko  aka criminal leader sasha biliy  today is heading a brigade of  pravyi sector   the radical militant driving force of the ongoing coup d  tat in kiev  according to his  official  biography  linkin russian   in      he was awarded by the then top commander of terroristichkeria enclave dzhohar dudayev with the order  hero of nation  for  outstanding military successes against russian troops   his  military skills  were quite specific  he used to lure the russian units operating in remote chechen locations to guerilla ambushes  then he personally participated in tortures and beheadings of the captured russian soldiers  after returning to the ukraine in       he led a criminal gang in rovno  eventually he was prosecuted and sentenced for   years term for kidnapping for ransom and attempted assassination of a ukrainian businessman  he entered politics after release from prison in late     s  after the end of chechen and balkan wars the british and american private military contractors were routinely recruiting ukrainian mercenaries for operations in afghanistan  iraq  syria and elsewhere the britam defense scandal revealed the way and scale of how the ukrainian personnel of the private military contractors were used in provocative clandestine actions to meet western political goals in the middle east  many of them were sent to kiev to make the job they are paid for   to target both policemen and protesters on  euromaidan  from the roofs of surrounding buildings  the real leaders of the protest have already clearly expressed their radical views to the european press  read e g  the interview with the pravyi sector leader dmitro yarosh and several recent guardian s publications here and here   that is the sort of people the half hearted european politicians are about to deal with in the ukraine  these fanatics are the real authority in today s kiev seized by the marauding mobs  they have torn the friday s agreement signed by four ukrainian  leaders  and three european officials before the ink was dry on this paper  their treatment of yulia timoshenko after her emotional speech on the maidan saturday night has clearly shown that her nomination de facto head of failing ukrainian state would be their decision  latest western advice to financially support the ukraine with the imf and the eu funds suggest that they have chosen to buy the loyalty of the ultranationalists for the transition period  therefore  the ongoing western policy of appeasement towards the radical insurgents in kiev very much resembles the anglo american connivance in hitler s accession to power in germany in      and the rise of the third reich  but if the western elitist groups suppose that the neo nazi project that they have carefully cherished and supported in the ukraine for decades  would be controlled by political means and set against russia  they are deadly wrong after facing furious resistance and blowback at the east and south of the ukraine  the radical nazi ideological avalanche encouraged by the illusion of success in kiev would inevitably enter the degrading european political landscape where the neo nazi and hooligan outbreaks are already a notable destabilizing factor  their established links with the islamist underground in europe add another sinister dimension to the murky european future   i ll be fighting

sector group leader  still from youtube video  kalashnikov wielding members of ukraine s radical nationalist opposition group  right sector  have pledged to resort to arms in their fight against those

squads will shoot the bastards on the spot  then there will be order and discipline   one of the radical nationalist opposition group leaders  aleksandr muzychko  said on friday  on february     when berkut police officers arrived in the western ukrainian town of rovno from kiev  muzychko said that if he met them on a battlefield  his hand  would not tremble    i would shoot   the right sector leader declared in rovno  where his supporters have already equipped themselves with kalashnikov rifles   if tomorrow these bastards  police  in kiev won t stop  we ll take over military units  get hold of armored personnel carriers and tanks   we know how to operate them   and go to kiev  victory will be ours  muzychko warned earlier this week  aleksandr muzychko is a notorious nationalist leader  back in      he pledged to fight against communists  jews and russians for as long as blood flows in his veins   openly saying that leading the fight against all of the above mentioned groups is his  credo   back in       muzychko  aka sashko bilyi  arrived in chechnya to join separatist forces  he took part in numerous battles with federal troops  mainly in the capital grozny  and personally knocked out three tanks  six armored personnel carriers and a sp vehicle  according to media reports  he led an entire federal forces unit  presumably the marines  into an ambush  as a result  it was destroyed by the chechen separatists  for his military merits  the notorious chechen militant leader  general dzhokhar dudayev  presented muzychko with a  hero of the nation  award  muzychko later served a term in a ukrainian prison for racketeering and gangsterism  but he claims it was only for political reasons   the next president of the country will be from right sector  our party will also be represented in parliament   he once promised  rioters from far right group  right sector  train in independence square in central kiev  january            reuters   david

leaders was finally signed  thousands are still protesting in central kiev  vitaly klitschko  opposition leader and head of the udar party was booed when he portrayed the latest deal as  very important   he even attempted to speak about the agreement during a recent memorial service for a protester killed during recent clashes  dmitry yarosh  right sector radical nationalist opposition group leader  told protesters that the deal between the ukrainian president and the opposition is unacceptable  saying their ultimate goal is yanukovich s resignation  the right sector will not lay down its arms   the unian news agency quoted him as saying   the right sector will not remove the blockade of one of the government buildings until our most important requirement is fulfilled   the resignation of yanukovich   the group rose to fame when its members  equipped with molotov cocktails and bombs  clashed with police in central kiev in mid january  a fighting training for opposition fighters from the right sector in a tent camp at independence square in kiev   ria novosti   andrey stenin  yarosh even proposes the liquidation of the pro government party of regions and the communist party of ukraine  calling them criminal groups whose activity must be stopped   two anti national groups have been acting this year in ukraine  they are responsible for numerous misfortunes of the ukrainian nation   said yarosh on his facebook page  adding that these two groups are the party of regions and the communist party of ukraine  he urged right sector members to stop the activity of these parties  by all means   meanwhile  the so called spilna sprava  common cause  opposition movement is demanding that the ukrainian parliament   the verkhovna rada  and ukrainian president viktor yanukovich  all step down   unfortunately  maidan square is not a safe place  my detention and custody were to have been decided upon within a few hours   says the group s leader aleksandr danilyuk  a lawyer and a rights activist who was earlier involved in campaigns against former president leonid kuchma  said on his facebook page  dmytro yarosh  c   a leader of the right sector movement  addresses during a rally in central independence square in kiev february            reuters   david mdzinarishvili   i ve finally reached london today  will have to coordinate in exile   he added  despite the absence of its leader  common cause has given an ultimatum to the kiev prison service demanding freedom for all political prisoners  if their demand is not fulfilled  then will use force  they say   tonight all political prisoners will be released  we have the power and means for it    said an official statement of the organization  just several months ago  common cause was hardly a household name in ukraine  when president yanukovich thwarted an integration deal with the eu in november in favor of closer ties with russia  common cause activists joined mass demonstrations calling for closer ties with europe  on    january in a bid to demonstrate their might  they held the energy ministry for a few hours in kiev  the event reportedly provoked strife within the opposition  with common cause activists ignoring the udar party leader s pleas to leave the ministry  the justice minister  elena lukash  then threatened to impose a state of emergency unless the radicals gave way  the ministry was only released after a telephone conversation between the interior minister  vitaly zakharchenko  and us ambassador to ukraine  jeffrey payette  happy

            "Debug Text -  monday    december      christmas card for a human world  without sarkozy  nicolas sarkozy  the crazy dog of elysee  circumstances of a libyan martirologe  by nino g  mucci  card for human world without html  the precipitated france s entry into a military conflict in libya  in february      in support of a politico tribal armed uprising that the french government had fed itself with its secret service  the frenzy to gain possession of new oil concessions and the infrastructure s re build following the massive and murderous bombings  are all signs that sarkozy has probably decided  in my opinion  for  a tragic failure   as all this machiavellian plans revealed themselves to be ineffective in destroying the resistance of the people loyal to the libyan leader gaddafi  and the geniality of his teachings of jamahiriya social democracy  the political or strategic result of putting hands surreptitiously on the resources of the leading country of africa  by initiating military action with the obvious participation of a vicious nato organization called on  humanitarian grounds  in support of an organized revolt  is indeed nothing but mass murder  as this caused direct massacre of tens of thousands of civilians  more than        victims of this abominable plan  often entire families and children killed  unimaginable sufferings  like the martyred city of sirte completely destroyed by aerial and ground bombardments  and moreover the most cynical and criminal lie of democracy and rights  producing the unspeakable torture and gross violations of human rights and even war rights committed in total impunity and media coverage by the same islamic extremists that the west is said to fight  but ultimately associated with its own imperialist and depraved schemes  nothing but mass murder which should include of course the total loss of moral credibility of west s politics and especially that of a cynical and megalomaniac man who sits shamefully chief of state of france  without any genuine human feeling  so that he can stand next to a disgusting hillary clinton  secretary of the nazi american zionism  the same who cheered the brutal  ignominious lynching of leader muammar gaddafi  the great colonel that received most recently as friend  should be a need to remember  the hero of the  white revolution  had decided to stay in a understandable and courageous decision against the treachery of the west  in his hometown sirte where he has been hurt by an air raids and he has been barbarously dragged dying by the cry of   allah waakhbar   by spiteful gangs of jihadist militants in the trash net of the western alliance  what kind of democracy or human rights state will never be able to rise by these savage hordes belonging to the new power in libya  we shall see soon the advanced human rights in a country where the  human  is gone away  we will also see the advanced women s rights  hanging out in burka or niqab under the yoke of sharia imposed by the new friends of france  between them the treachery s master abdeljalil mustafa with his obscure programs  thanks to france  the land of voltaire and montesquieu  what these new acquired political cops of sarkozy  he is not even worth the boot of the grand colonel who first braved the anglo american schemes in september      with no bloodshed  leading his country to a path of social  political and economic liberation  spreading ideals which came in the real genius of the old visionary bedouin by a passionate love for his land  love for libya  for africa as for a world united by sense of dignity and equality against any imperialist apartheid  and how much sabotage  how much hatred the countries of western capitalism returned against him  before any other the united states  with libya under embargo and bombing and the leader of the libyan jamahiriya under the target of commando killers up to the fatal day  but the libyan tenets of jamahiriya do not die  nor do the teachings of popular direct democracy  nor the leader gaddafi is removed from the millions hearts of true patriots  despite the murderous hatred and all the nato sponsored tags  and those of theirs deadly friends  could you ever imagine sarkozy be a martyr for france   no  say it laughing  sarkozy has now really lost  he has definitely chosen a  tragic failure  for europe and the west  creating just a huge site of death in libya  another hopeless place of conflict such as iraq  dragging behind many other heads of state in the same treachery towards the african continent  the hypocrisy of his words echoes with even greater significance in the results of the social unrest in tunisia in january      bringing to the collapse of the president ben ali  in power for twenty two years  it was still trying to get in june      for tunisia  advanced status   to establish a stronger partnership with the european union in march       he submitted to brussels a document that the eu commissioner for enlargement and neighbourhood policy stefan fule qualified for important  stumbling particularly on the subject of freedoms and human rights  according to a statement released by the associated press  the european official noted that  the ambition to advance cooperation should apply to political  economic  social  energy fields  investment and cooperation  justice and freedom  but also that of human rights and the rule of law       despite the good promises from tunisia  the cooperation agreement  under which the european union committed to grant tunisia a budget of     million euros in the period               was suspended immediately after the situation of repression by ben ali s regime during the social demonstrations in the south and inside the country in january       there was  however  no need at the time for a  humanitarian intervention  of sarkozy and his misanthropic friend bernard henry levi  even to tell some words  in the oil and gas poor tunisia  no surprise that since the beginning of social unrest in tunisia  the french foreign minister  michele alliot marie  believed that france was not to  give lessons  to tunisia  to this  jean pierre sueur  president of the friendship group france tunisia in the senate  could replicate in a brilliant article published by le monde   france does not give lessons to tunisia but it must speak clearly  as it does to other countries in which it condemned the policy       the intervention in libya  implemented by france under  humanitarian  pretext to catch up such a diplomatic offered disgrace by doing an international crime  separates the west from any honour bound to a real peace project  knowing clearly what the tunisian newspaper essabah  and two major algerian newspapers  el khabar and el watan among others  soon said without failing      that military intervention was fed only by the libyan oil that sharpens the west s appetite  an anti capitalist journal online  apart from the almost absolute silence of criticism in the mainstream media  said at the right time   the same people who justify the bombing of libya on humanitarian grounds  are directly involved in the repression of the democratic movement in bahrain and yemen  troops from saudi arabia and the uae have entered the country at the request of the king of bahrain and with the approval of obama to suppress entirely peaceful motions and assassinate the leaders of the movement       while the back and forth of military eu coalition aircraft guided by france was raining missiles on tripoli and unprepared defensive infrastructure of gaddafi  tunisia changed three times a transitional government  knowing a period of exceptional chaos  a period of violent social demands  lawlessness of some areas where   there is bitterly the illegal occupation of land belonging to the state  invasion of holy shrines  illegal search of archaeological areas  looting of homes and shops         at sidi bouzid  major outbreak place of the revolt of january       even the natural parks are not spared from violence and vandalism against agents  equipment and animals  in areas near the libyan border and other maritime areas  groups of criminals organized clandestine departures almost with impunity  and thousands of illegal immigrants landed on the italian coast of the island of lampedusa  causing expenses and sufferings to the populations  of which france washed completely the hands  adopting a policy of rejection of any tunisian illegal immigrate as from north africa in general  where the  humanitarian concerns  expressed by sarkozy for libya  ever vanished here  sarkozy s demagogy breaks down  the truth defines itself clearly  all has been done to maintain western economic and political subjugation of the maghreb and africa  and for an indefinite time confiscate their future  now it is just here where europe s diplomacy faces the question of its own survival  as long as within its geographical borders in continuous expansion  inside the social body of its multiform and multilingual and multinational diversity  is too often blunt hypocrisy the real stuff of its politics  europe must not be separated from its soul  as nobody could ever forget the religious heritage that founded its civilization  and above all  it cannot  at the price of disappearing by its own sin of pride  put itself at odds with the luminous message of the messiah from nazareth who was first included in all ethical codes beyond national differences  recognize in the love of god to manhood  the fundamental principle of respect for human life  say it is a christmas thought  or a christmas wish  nevertheless this is what we must emphasize above all else  if we really want to realize the deep moral and legal gap in relation to the human rights between western and third world countries or to those defining muslims  and that s why i send this christmas card  france cannot wait more anxiously the departure of someone to his

            "Debug Text -  in the beginning of april      the provisional government had discovered to its surprise that russian finances  already for some time in quite bad shape  were on the brink of complete collapse  in an attempt to mend the situation  and stir enthusiastic patriotism  the government loudly  announced the issuance of domestic freedom loan bonds  rumors about the loan had began circulating as early as march and minister of finance tereshchenko informed the press that there were already multi million pledges from bankers to buy bonds   mainly from the jewish bankers  which is undoubtedly related to the abolition of religious and national restrictions      indeed  as soon as the loan was officially announced  names of large jewish subscribers began appearing in newspapers  accompanied by prominent front page appeals   jewish citizens  subscribe to the freedom loan   and  every jew must have the freedom loan bonds      in a single subscription drive in a moscow synagogue    million rubles was collected  during the first two days  jews in tiflis subscribed to     million rubles of bonds  jews in minsk   to half a million in the first week  the saratov community   to     thousand rubles of bonds  in kiev  the heirs of brodsky and klara ginzburg each spent one million  the jews abroad came forward as well  jacob schiff    million  rothschild in london    million  in paris  on the initiative of baron ginzburg  russian jews participated actively and subscribed to severalmillion worth of bonds     at the same time  the jewish committee in support for freedom loan was established and appealed to public     however  the government was very disappointed with the overall result of the first month of the subscription  for encouragement  the lists of major subscribers  who purchased bonds on    thousand rubles or more  were published several times  in the beginning of may  in the beginning of june and in the end of july   the rich who did not subscribe     were shamed  what is most striking is not the sheer number of jewish names on the lists  assimilated russian germans with their precarious situation during the russo german war were in the second place among bond holders  but the near absence of the top russian bourgeoisie  apart from a handful of prominent moscow entrepreneurs  in politics   left and center parties burgeoned and many jews had became politically active      from the very first days after the february revolution  central newspapers published an enormous number of announcements about private meetings  assemblies and sessions of various jewish parties  initially mostly the bund  but later poale zion  zionists  socialist zionists  territorialist zionists  and the socialist jewish workers  party  sjwp   by march   we already read about an oncoming assembly of the all russian jewish congress   finally  the pre revolutionary idea of dubnov had become widely accepted  however   because of sharp differences between zionists and bundists   the congress did not materialize in       nor did it occur in      either  because of the civil war and antagonism of bolshevik authorities        in petrograd  jewish people s group was re established with m  vinaver at the helm      they were liberals  not socialists  initially  they hoped to establish an alliance with jewish socialists  vinaver declared   we applaud the bund   the vanguard of the revolutionary movement      yet the socialists stubbornly rejected all gestures of rapprochement  the rallying of jewish parties in petrograd had indirectly indicated that by the time of revolution the jewish population there was already substantial and energetic  surprisingly  despite the fact that almost no  jewish proletariat  existed in petrograd  the bund was very successful there  it was extraordinarily active in petrograd  arranging a number of meetings of local organization  in the lawyer s club and then on april   in the tenishev s school   there was a meeting with a concert in the mikhailovsky theatre  then on april        the all russian conference of the bund took place  at which a demand to establish a national and cultural jewish autonomy in russia was brought forward again         after conclusion of speeches  all the conference participants had sung the bund s anthem oath  the internationale  and la marseillaise        and  as in past  bund had to balance its national and revolutionary platforms  in      it struggled for the independence from the russian social democratic labor party  and yet in      it rushed headlong into the all russian revolution  likewise  now  in       the bund s representatives occupied prominent positions in the executive committee of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  a soviet is the russian term used for an elected  at least in theory  council  and later among the social democrats of kiev   by the end of      the bund had nearly     sections countrywide  totaling around        members       developments in poale zion were no less amazing  in the beginning of april they also held their all russian conference in moscow  among its resolutions we see on the one hand a motion to organize the all russian jewish congress and discuss the problem of emigration to palestine  on the other hand  the poale zion conference in odessa had simultaneously announced the party s uncompromising program of class warfare   through the efforts of jewish revolutionary democracy the power over destinies of the jewish nation was     wrested from the dirty grasp of  wealthy and settled  jews despite all the resistance of bourgeoisie to the right and the bund to the left     do not allow the bourgeois parties to bring in the garbage of the old order     do not let the hypocrites speak   they did not fight but sweated out the rights for our people on their bended knees in the offices of anti semitic ministers      they did not believe in the revolutionary action of the masses   then  in april       when the party had split the  radical socialist  poale zion moved toward the zionists  breaking away from the main  social democratic  poale zion      which later would join the third international      like the two above mentioned parties  the sjwp also held its statewide conference at which it had merged with the socialist zionists  forming the united jewish socialist workers  party  fareynikte  and parting with the idea  of any extraterritorial jewish nation  with its own parliament and national autonomy   fareynikte appealed to the provisional government asking it to declare equality of languages and to establish a council on the affairs of nationalities  which would specifically  fund jewish schools and public agencies   at the same time  fareynikte closely collaborated with the socialist revolutionaries      however  it was zionism that became the most influential political force in the jewish milieu      as early as the beginning of march  the resolution of petrograd s zionist assembly contained the following wording   the russian jewry is called upon to support the provisional government in every possible way  to enthusiastic work  to national consolidation and organization for the sake of the prosperity of jewish national life in russia and the national and political renaissance of jewish nation in palestine   and what an inspiring historical moment it was   march        with the british troops closing on jerusalem right at that time  already on march    the proclamation of odessa s zionists stated   today is the time when states rearrange themselves on national foundations  woe to us if we miss this historic opportunity   in april  the zionist movement was strongly reinforced by the public announcement of jacob schiff  who had decided to join zionists  because of fear of jewish assimilation as a result of jewish civil equality in russia  he believes that palestine could become the center to spread ideals of jewish culture all over the world       in the beginning of may  zionists held a large meeting in the building of petrograd stock exchange  with zionist hymns performed several times  in the end of may the all russian zionist conference was held in the petrograd conservatory  it outlined major zionist objectives  cultural revival of the jewish nation   social revolution in the economic structure of jewish society to transform the  nation of merchants and artisans into the nation of farmers and workers   an increase in emigration to palestine and  mobilization of jewish capital to finance the jewish settlers    both jabotinsky s plan on creation of a jewish legion in the british army and the i  trumpeldorf s plan for the  formation of a jewish army in russia which would cross the caucasus and liberate eretz yisrael  the land of israel  from turkish occupation have been discussed and rejected on the basis of the neutrality of zionists in the world war i       the zionist conference decreed to vote during the oncoming local elections for the parties  not farther to the right than the people s socialists   and even to refuse to support constitutional democrats like d  pasmanik  who later complained   it was absolutely meaningless   it looked like the entire russian jewry  with its petty and large bourgeoisie  are socialists       his bewilderment was not unfounded  the congress of student zionist organization  gekhover  with delegates from    cities and all russian universities  had taken place in the beginning of april in petrograd  their resolution stated that the jews were suffering not for the sake of equality in russia but for the rebirth of jewish nation in the native palestine  they decided to form legions in russia to conquer palestine  overall   during the summer and fall of      zionism in russia continued to gain strength  by september its members numbered               it is less known that in      jewish  orthodox movements enjoyed substantial popularity second only to the zionists and ahead of the socialist parties   as illustrated by their success  during elections of the leadership of reorganized jewish communities        there were rallies   the jews are together with the democratic russia in both love and hatred     public lectures   the jewish question and the russian revolution    city wide  assemblies of jewish high school students  in petrograd and other cities  aside from general student meetings   in petrograd  the central organ of jewish students was established  though not recognized by the bund and other leftist parties  while many provincial committees for the assistance to the  victims of the war   i e   to jewish refugees and deportees  ceased to exist because at this time  democratic forces needed to engage in broader social activities   and so the central jewish committee for providing such aid was formed by april  in may the jewish people s union was established to facilitate consolidation of all jewish forces  to prepare for the convocation of the all russian jewish union and to get ready for the oncoming elections to the constituent assembly  in the end of may there was another attempt of unification  the steering committee of the jewish democratic alliance convened the conference of all jewish democratic organizations in russia  meanwhile  lively public discussion went on regarding convocation of the all russian jewish congress  the bund rejected it as inconsistent with their plans  the zionists demanded the congress include on their agenda the question of palestine   and were themselves rejected by the rest  in july the all russian conference on the jewish congress preparation took place in petrograd      because of social enthusiasm  vinaver was able to declare there that the idea of united jewish nation  dispersed among different countries  is ripe  and that from now on the russian jews may not be indifferent to the situation of jews in other countries  such as romania or poland  the congress date was set for december  what an upsurge of jewish national energy it was  even amid the upheavals of       jewish social and political activities stood out in their diversity  vigor and organization  the  period between february and november      was the time of blossoming  of jewish culture and healthcare  in addition to the petrograd publication the jews of russia  the publisher of the jewish week had moved to petrograd  publication of the petrograd torgblat in yiddish had begun  similar publications were started in other cities  the tarbut and culture league  a network of secular  hebrew language schools  had established  dozens of kindergartens  secondary and high schools and pedagogic colleges  teaching both in yiddish and in hebrew  a jewish grammar school was founded in kiev  in april  the first all russian congress on jewish culture and education was held in moscow  it requested state funding for jewish schools a conference of the society of admirers of jewish language and culture took place  the habima theatre   the first professional theatre in hebrew in the world       opened in moscow  there were an exposition of jewish artists and a conference of the society on jewish health care in april in moscow  these jewish activities are all the more amazing given the state of general governmental  administrative and cultural confusion in russia       a major event in the jewish life of the time was the granting of official permission for jewish youth to enlist as officers in the russian army  it was a large scale move  in april  the headquarters of the petrograd military district had issued an order to the commanders of guards military units to immediately post all jewish students to the training battalion at nizhny novgorod with the purpose of their further assignment to military academies       that is virtually mass scale promotion of young jews into the officer ranks   already in the beginning of june           jews graduated from the accelerated military courses at the konstantinovsky military academy in kiev as officers  in the summer      odessa      jewish cadets were promoted into officers       in june      jews were promoted to warrant officer rank all over russia  there is evidence that in some military academies junkers  used in tsarist russia for cadets and young officers  met jewish newcomers unkindly  as it was in the alexandrovsky military academy after more than     jews had been posted to it  in the mikhailovsky military academy a group of junkers proposed a resolution that   although we are not against the jews in general  we consider it inconceivable to let them into the command ranks of the russian army   the officers of the academy dissociated themselves from this statement and a group of socialist junkers      strong  had expressed their disapproval   finding anti jewish protests shameful for the revolutionary army       and the resolution did not pass  when jewish warrant officers arrived to their regiments  they often encountered mistrust and enmity on the part of soldiers for whom having jews as officers was extremely unusual and strange   yet the newly minted officers who adopted new revolutionary style of behavior gained popularity lightning fast   on the other hand  the way jewish junkers from the military academy in odessa behaved was simply striking  in the end of march      jews had been accepted into the academy  barely three weeks later  on april    old style  there was a first of may parade in odessa and the jewish junkers marched ostentatiously singing ancient jewish songs  did they not understand that russian soldiers would hardly follow such officers  what kind of officers were they going to become  it would be fine if they were being prepared for the separate jewish battalions  yet according to general denikin  the year      saw successful formation of all kinds of national regiments   polish  ukrainian  transcaucasian  the latvian units were already in place for a while    except the jewish ones  it was  the only nationality not demanding national self determination in military  and every time  when in response to complaints about bad acceptance of jewish officers in army formation of separate jewish regiments was suggested  such a proposal was met with a storm of indignation on the part of jews and the left and with accusations of a spiteful provocation        newspapers had reported that germans also planned to form separate jewish regiments but the project was dismissed   it appears  though  that new jewish officers still wanted some national organization in the military  in odessa on august     the convention of jewish officers decided to establish a section which would be responsible for connections between different fronts  to report on the situation of jewish officers in the field   in august   unions of jewish warriors appeared  by october such unions were present at all fronts and in many garrisons  during the october             conference in kiev  the all russian union of jewish warriors was founded        although it was a new  revolutionary army   some reporters still harbored hostility toward officer corps in general and to officer s epaulettes in particular  for instance  a  alperovich whipped up emotions against officers in general in birzhevye vedomosti  stock exchange news  as late as may         various sources indicate that jews were not eager to be drafted as common soldiers even in       apparently  there were instances when to avoid the draft sick individuals passed off as genuine conscripts at the medical examining boards  and  as a result  some district draft commissions began demanding photo ids from jewish conscripts  an unusual practice in those simple times   it immediately triggered angry protests that such a requirement goes against the repulsion of national restrictions  and the ministry of internal affairs forbade asking for such ids  in the beginning of april the provisional government issued an order by telegraph to free without individual investigation all jews previously exiled as suspects of espionage  some of them resided in the now occupied territories  while others could safely return home  and yet many deportees asked for permission to reside in the cities of the european part of russia  there was a flow of jews into petrograd  jewish population of        in           and a sharp increase of jewish population in moscow               russian jews received less numerous  but highly energetic reinforcement from abroad  take those two famous trains that crossed hostile germany without hindrance and brought to russia nearly     prominent individuals     in lenin s and     in natanson martov s train  with jews comprising an absolute majority  the lists of passengers of the  exterritorial trains  were for the first time published by v  burtsev       they represented almost all jewish parties  and virtually all of them would play a substantial role in the future events in russia  hundreds of jews returned from the united states  former emigrants  revolutionaries  and draft escapees   now they all were the  revolutionary fighters  and  victims of tsarism   by order of kerensky  the russian embassy in the usa issued russian passports to anyone who could provide just two witnesses  to testify to identity  literally from the street   the situation around trotsky s group was peculiar  they were apprehended in canada on suspicion of connections with germany  the investigation found that trotsky travelled not with flimsy russian papers  but with a solid american passport  inexplicably granted to him despite his short stay in the usa  and with a substantial sum of money  the source of which remained a mystery       on june    at the exalted  russian rally in new york city   directed by p  rutenberg  one time friend and then a murderer of gapon   abraham kagan  the editor of jewish newspaper forwards  addressed russian ambassador bakhmetev  on behalf of two million russian jews residing in the united states of america    we have always loved our motherland  we have always sensed the links of brotherhood with the entire russian nation     our hearts are loyal to the red banner of the russian liberation and to the national tricolor of the free russia   he had also claimed that the self sacrifice of the members of narodnaya volya  literally  the people s will  a terrorist leftwing revolutionary group in tsarist russia  best known for its assassination of tsar alexander ii  known as  the tsar liberator for ending serfdom   was directly connected to the fact of increased persecution of the jews  and that  people like zundelevich  deich  gershuni  liber and abramovich were among the bravest       and so they had begun coming back  and not just from new york  judging by the official introduction of discounted railroad fare for  political emigrants  travelling from vladivostok  at the late july rally in whitechapel  london   it was found that in london alone        jews declared their willingness to return to russia   the final resolution had expressed pleasure that  jews would go back to struggle for the new social and democratic russia       destinies of many returnees  hurrying to participate in the revolution and jumping headlong into the thick of things  were outstanding  among the returnees were the famous v  volodarsky  m  uritsky  and yu  larin  the latter was the author of the  war communism economy  program  it is less known that yakov sverdlov s brother  veniamin  was also among the returnees  still  he would not manage to rise higher than the deputy narkom  people s commissar  of communications and a member of board of the supreme soviet of the national economy  moisei kharitonov  lenin s associate in emigration who returned to russia in the same train with him  quickly gained notoriety by assisting the anarchists in their famous robbery in april  later he was the secretary of perm  saratov and sverdlov gubkoms  guberniya s party committee   and the secretary of urals bureau of the central committee  semyon dimanshtein  a member of a bolshevik group in paris  would become the head of the jewish commissariat at the people s commissariat of nationalities  and later the head of yevsek  jewish section  at the all russian central executive committee  he would in fact supervise the entire jewish life  amazingly  at the age of    he managed  to pass qualification test to become a rabbi  and became a member of the russian social democratic workers  party   all this in course of one year      similarly  members of the trotsky s group had also fared well  the jeweler g  melnichansky  the accountant friman  the typographer a  minkin menson  and the decorator gomberg zorin had respectively headed soviet trade unions  pravda  the dispatch office of bank notes and securities  and the petrograd revolutionary tribunal  names of other returnees after the february revolution are now completely forgotten  yet wrongly so  as they played important roles in the revolutionary events  for example  the doctor of biology ivan zalkind had actively participated in the october coup and then in fact ran trotsky s people s commissariat of internal affairs  semyon kogan semkov became the  political commissar of izhevsk weapons and steel factories  in november       that is he was in charge of the vindictive actions during suppression of major uprising of izhevsk workers     known for its large  in many thousands  victim s toll  in a single incident on the sobornaya square in izhevsk     workers were gunned down      tobinson krasnoshchekov later headed the entire far east as the secretary of the far east bureau and the head of local government  girshfeld stashevsky under the pseudonym  verkhovsky  was in command of a squad of german pows and turncoats  that is  he laid foundation for the bolshevik international squads  in      he was the head of clandestine intelligence at the western front  later  in peacetime   he  on orders of cheka presidium  had organized intelligence network in the western europe   he was awarded the title of  honorary chekist       among returnees were many who did not share bolshevik views  at least at the time of arrival  but they were nevertheless welcomed into the ranks of lenin s and trotsky s party  for instance  although yakov fishman  a member of the military revolutionary committee of the october coup  had deviated from the bolshevik mainstream by participating in the left socialist revolutionary insurrection in july       he was later accepted into the russian communist party of bolsheviks  rcpb  and entrusted with a post in the military intelligence administration of the red army  or take yefim yarchuk  who had returned as an anarchist syndicalist  but was delegated by the petrograd soviet to reinforce the kronstadt soviet  during the october coup he had brought a squad of sailors to petrograd to storm the winter palace  the returnee vsevolod volin eikhenbaum  the brother of the literary scholar  was a consistent supporter of anarchism and the ideologist of makhno  a ukrainian separatist anarchist  movement  he was the head of the revolutionary military soviet in the makhno army  we know that makno was more of an advantage than a detriment to bolsheviks and as a result volin was later merely forced to emigrate together with a dozen of other anarchists      the expectations of returnees were not unfounded  those were the months marked by a notable rise to prominence for many jews in russia   the jewish question exists no longer in russia        still  in the newspaper essay by d  aizman  sura alperovich  the wife of a merchant who moved from minsk to petrograd  had expressed her doubts   so there is no more slavery and that s it   so what about the things  that  nicholas of yesterday  did to us in kishinev  in regard to the kishinev pogrom          in another article david aizman thus elaborated his thought   jews must secure the gains of revolution by any means     without any qualms  any necessary sacrifice must be made  everything is on the stake here and all will be lost if we hesitate     even the most backward parts of jewish mass understand this    no one questions what would happen to jews if the counter revolution prevails   he was absolutely confident that if that happens there would be mass executions of jews  therefore   the filthy scum must be crushed even before it had any chance to develop  in embryo  their very seed must be destroyed     jews will be able to defend their freedom       crushed in embryo     and even their very seed     it was already pretty much the bolshevik program  though expressed in the words of old testament  yet whose seed must be destroyed  monarchists   but they were already breathless  all their activists could be counted on fingers  so it could only be those who had taken a stand against the unbridled  running wild soviets  against all kinds of committees and mad crowds  those  who wished to halt the breakdown of life in the country   prudent ordinary people  former government officials  and first of all officers and very soon the soldier general kornilov  there were jews among those counter revolutionaries  but overall that movement was the russian national one  what about press  in       the influence of print media grew  the number of periodicals and associated journalists and staff was rising  before the revolution  only a limited number of media workers qualified for draft deferral  and only those who were associated with newspapers and printing offices which were established in the pre war years   they were classified as  defense enterprises  despite their desperate fight against governmental and military censorship   but now  from april  on the insistence of the publishers  press privileges were expanded with respect to the number of workers exempt from military service  newly founded political newspapers were henceforth also covered by the exemption  sometimes fraudulently as the only thing needed to qualify was maintaining a circulation of        for at least two weeks   draft privileges were introduced on the basis of youth  for the  political emigrants  and those  released from exile    everything that favored employment of new arrivals in the leftist newspapers  at the same time  rightist newspapers were being closed  malenkaya gazeta  small newspaper  and narodnaya gazeta  people s newspaper  were shut down for accusing bolsheviks of having links with germans  when many newspapers published the telegrams fraudulently attributed to the empress and the fake was exposed  it was  an innocent joke of a telegraph operator lady   for which  of course  she was never disciplined  and so they had to retract their pieces  birzhevye vedomosti  for instance  had produced such texts   it turned out that neither the special archive at the main department of post and telegraph  where the royal telegrams were stored  nor the head office of telegraph contain any evidence of this correspondence       see  they presented it as if the telegrams were real but all traces of their existence had been skillfully erased  what a brave free press  as early as in the beginning of march the prudent vinaver had warned the jewish public   apart from love for freedom  self control is needed     it is better for us to avoid highly visible and prominent posts     do not hurry to practice our rights       we know that vinaver  and also dan  liber and branson   at different times have been offered minister posts  but all of them refused  believing that jews should not be present in russian government   the attorney vinaver could not  of course  reject his sensational appointment to the senate  where he became one of four jewish senators  together with g  blumenfeld  o  gruzenberg  and i  gurevich       there were no jews among the ministers but four influential jews occupied posts of deputy ministers  v  gurevich was a deputy to avksentiev  the minister of internal affairs  s  lurie was in the ministry of trade and industry  s  schwartz and a  ginzburg naumov   in the ministry of labor  and p  rutenberg should be mentioned here too  from july  a  galpern became the chief of the administration of the provisional government  after v  nabokov       the director of  st department in the ministry of foreign affairs was a  n  mandelshtam  the assistant to the head of the moscow military district was second lieutenant sher  since july        from may  the head of foreign supply department at general staff was a  mikhelson  the commissar of the provisional government in the field construction office was naum glazberg  several jews were incorporated by chernov into the central land committee responsible for everything related to allotting land to peasants  of course  most of those were not key posts  having negligibly small influence when compared to the principal role of the executive committee  whose ethnic composition would soon become a hotly debated public worry  at the august government conference dedicated to the disturbing situation in the country  apart from the representatives of soviets  parties  and guilds  a separate representation was granted to the ethnic groups of russia  with jews represented by eight delegates  including g  sliozberg  m  liber  n  fridman  g  landau  and o  gruzenberg  the favorite slogan of      was  expand the revolution   all socialist parties worked to implement it  i  o  levin writes   there is no doubt that jewish representation in the bolshevik and other parties which facilitated  expanding of revolution    mensheviks  socialist revolutionaries  etc    with respect to both general jewish membership and jewish presence among the leaders  greatly exceeds the jewish share in the population of russia  this is an indisputable fact  while its reasons should be debated  its factual veracity is unchallengeable and its denial is pointless   and  a certainly convincing explanation of this phenomenon by jewish inequality before the march revolution     is still not sufficiently exhaustive       members of central committees of the socialist parties are known  interestingly  jewish representation in the leadership of mensheviks  the right and the left socialist revolutionaries  and the anarchists was much greater than among the bolshevik leaders  at the socialist revolutionary congress  which took place in the end of may and beginning of june          out of     delegates were jewish  and out of    members of the central committee of the party elected during the congress    were jewish  a  gotz was one of the leaders of the right wing faction and m  natanson was among the leaders of the left socialist revolutionaries        what a despicable role awaited natanson   the wise mark   one of the founder of russian narodnichestvo   populism    during the war  living abroad  he was receiving financial aid from germany  in may      he returned in russia in one of the  extraterritorial trains  across germany  in russia  he had immediately endorsed lenin and threw his weight in support of the latter s goal of dissolving the constituent assembly  actually  it was he who had voiced this idea first  though lenin  of course  needed no such nudge   local government elections took place in the summer  overall  socialist parties were victorious  and  jews actively participated in the local and municipal work in a number of cities and towns outside of the  former  pale of settlement   for instance  socialist revolutionary o  minor  became head of the moscow city duma  member of the central committee of the bund  a  vainshtein  rakhmiel  of the minsk duma  menshevik i  polonsky  of the ekaterinoslav duma  bundist d  chertkov  of the saratov duma   g  shreider had become the mayor of petrograd  and a  ginzburg naumov was elected a deputy mayor in kiev       but most of these persons were gone with the october coup and it was not they who shaped the subsequent developments in russia  it would become the lot of those who now occupied much lower posts  mostly in the soviets  they were numerous and spread all over the country  take  for instance  khinchuk  head of the moscow soviet of workers  deputies  or nasimovich and m  trilisser of the irkutsk soviet  the latter would later serve in the central executive committee of the soviets of siberia and become a famous chekist       all over the provinces  jewish socialist parties enjoyed large representation in the soviets of workers  and soldiers  deputies       they were also prominently presented at the all russian democratic conference in september       which annoyed lenin so much that he had even demanded surrounding the alexandrinsky theater with troops and arresting the entire assembly   the theater s superintendent  comrade nashatyr  would have to act on the order  but trotsky had dissuaded lenin   and even after the october coup  the moscow soviet of soldiers  deputies had among its members  according to bukharin   dentists  pharmacists  etc     representatives of trades as close to the soldier s profession as to that of the chinese emperor       but above all of that  above all of russia  from the spring to the autumn of       stood the power of one body   and it was not the provisional government  it was the powerful and insular executive committee of the petrograd soviet  and later  after june  the successor to its power  the all russian central executive committee  cec    it was they who had in fact ruled over russia  while appearing solid and determined from outside  in reality they were being torn apart by internal contradictions and inter factional ideological confusion  initially  the executive committee of the petrograd soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies unanimously approved the order no     but later was doubtful about the war   whether to continue destroying army or to strengthen it   quite unexpectedly  they declared their support for the freedom loan  thus they had incensed the bolsheviks but agreed with the public opinion on this issue  including the attitudes of liberal jews   the presidium of the first all russian cec of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  the first governing soviet body  consisted of nine men  among them were the social revolutionaries  srs  a  gots and m  gendelman  the menshevik  f  dan  and the member of bund  m  liber   in march at the all russian conference of the soviets  gendelman and steklov had demanded stricter conditions be imposed on the tsar s family  which was under house arrest  and also insisted on the arrest of all crown princes   this is how confident they were in their power   the prominent bolshevik  l  kamenev  was among the members of that presidium  it also included the georgian  chkheidze  the armenian  saakjan  one krushinsky  most likely a pole  and nikolsky  likely a russian   quite an impudent  ethnic  composition for the governing organ of russia in such a critical time  apart from the cec of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  there was also the all russian executive committee of the soviet of peasants  deputies  elected in the end of may  of its    members  there were only three actual peasants   an already habitual sham of the pre bolshevik regime  of those thirty  d  pasmanik identified seven jews   a sad thing it was  especially considering jewish interests   and  they had become an eyesore to everybody       then this peasant organ put forward a list of its candidates for the future constituent assembly  apart from kerensky  the list contained several jews  such as the boisterous ilya rubanovich  who had just arrived from paris  the terrorist abram gots  and the little known gurevich         in the same article  there was a report on the arrest for desertion of warrant officer m  golman  the head of the mogilev guberniya  a peasant soviet       of course  the actions of the executive committees could not be solely explained by their ethnic composition   not at all   many of those personalities irreversibly distanced themselves from their native communities and had even forgotten the way to their shtetls   all of them sincerely believed that because of their talents and revolutionary spirit  they would have no problem arranging workers   soldiers  and peasants  matters in the best way possible  they would manage it better simply because of being more educated and smarter than all this clumsy hoi polloi  yet for many russians  from commoners to generals  this sudden  eye striking transformation in the appearance of those among the directors and orators at rallies and meetings  in command and in government  was overwhelming  v  stankevich  the only officer socialist in the executive committee  provided an example   this fact  of the abundance of jews in the committee  alone had enormous influence on the public opinion and sympathies     noteworthy  when kornilov met with the committee for the first time  he had accidently sat in the midst of jews  in front of him sat two insignificant and plain members of the committee  whom i remember merely because of their grotesquely jewish facial features  who knows how that affected kornilov s attitudes toward russian revolution       yet the treatment of all things russian by the new regime was very tale telling  here is an example from the  days of kornilov  in the end of august       russia was visibly dying  losing the war  with its army corrupted and the rear in collapse  general kornilov  cunningly deceived by kerensky  artlessly appealed to the people  almost howling with pain   russian people  our great motherland is dying  the hour of her death is nigh     all  whose bosoms harbor a beating russian heart  go to the temples and pray to god to grant us the greatest miracle of salvation for our beloved country       in response to that the ideologist of the february revolution and one of the leading members of the executive committee  gimmer sukhanov  chuckled in amusement   what an awkward  silly  clueless  politically illiterate call     what a lowbrow imitation of suzdalshchina   suzdalshchina  refers to resistance in suzdal to the mongol invaders        yes  it sounded pompously and awkwardly  without a clear political position  indeed  kornilov was not a politician but his heart ached  and what about sukhanov s heart   did he feel any pain at all  he did not have any sense of the living land and culture  nor he had any urge to preserve them   he served to his ideology only  the international  seeing in kornilov s words a total lack of ideological content  yes  his response was caustic  but note that he had not only labeled kornilov s appeal an  imitation   he had also derogatorily referred to  suzdalshchina   to russian history  ancient art and sanctity  and with such disdain to the entire russian historical heritage  all that internationalist ilk   sukhanov and his henchmen from the malicious executive committee  steered the february revolution  and it was not the ethnic origin of sukhanov and the rest  it was their anti national  anti russian and anti conservative attitudes  we have seen similar attitudes on the part of the provisional government too  with its task of governing the entire russia and its quite russian ethnic composition  yet did it display a russian worldview or represent russian interests if only a little  not at all  the government s most consistent and  patriotic  activity was to guide the already unraveling country  the  kronstadt republic  was not the only place which had  seceded from russia  by that time  to the victory in war  to the victory at any cost  with loyalty to the allies   sure  the allies  their governments  public and financers  put pressure on russia  for instance  in may  russian newspapers cited the morning post from washington   america made it clear to the russian government  that if  russia  makes a separate peace  with germany   the united states would  annul all financial agreements with russia        prince lvov  prince georgi lvov  led the russian provisional government during the russian revolution s initial phase  from march      until he relinquished control to alexander kerensky in july       upheld the sentiment   the country must determinately send its army to battle        they had no concern about consequences of the ongoing war for russia  and this mismatch  this loss of sense of national self preservation  could be observed almost at every meeting of the provisional government cabinet  almost in every discussion  there were simply ridiculous incidents  throwing millions of rubles left and right and always keenly supporting  cultural needs of ethnic minorities   the provisional government at its april   meeting had rejected the request of the long established  great russian orchestra of v  v  andreev  to continue getting paid as before   from the funds of the former his majesty s personal chancellery   the funds were confiscated by the provisional government itself   the petition was turned down despite the fact that the requested sum     thousand rubles per year  was equivalent to the annual pay of just three minister assistants   deny    why not disband your so called  great russian  orchestra    what kind of name is that   taken aback and believing that it was just a misunderstanding  andreev petitioned again  yet with an unusual for this torpid government determination  he was refused a second time too  at the april    meeting      milyukov  a russian historian and minister of the provisional government  did not utter a single specifically russian sentiment during that year  similarly   the key figure of the revolution   alexander kerensky  could not be at any stage accused of possessing an ethnic russian consciousness  yet at the same time the government demonstrated constant anxious bias against any conservative circles  and especially   against russian conservatives  even during his last speech in the council of the russian republic  pre parliament  on october     when trotsky s troops were already seizing petrograd building after building  kerensky emphatically argued that the bolshevik newspaper rabochy put  worker s way  and the right wing novaya rus  new russia    both of which kerensky had just shut down   shared similar political views     the  darned incognito  of the members of the executive committee was  of course  noticed by the public  initially it was the educated society of petrograd that was obsessed with this question  which several times surfaced in newspapers  for two months  the committee tried to keep the secret  but by may they had no other choice but reveal themselves and had published the actual names of most of the pseudonym holders  except for steklov nakhamkis and boris osipovich bogdanov  the energetic permanent chair of the council  they had managed to keep their identities secret for a while  the latter s name confused the public by similarity with another personality  bogdanov malinovsky   this odd secrecy irritated the public  and even ordinary citizens began asking questions  it was already typical in may that if  during a plenary meeting of the soviet  someone proposed zinoviev or kamenev for something  the public shouted from the auditorium demanding their true names  concealing true names was incomprehensible to the ordinary man of that time  only thieves hide and change their names  why is boris katz ashamed of his name  and instead calling himself  kamkov   why does lurie hide under the alias of  larin   why does mandelshtam use the pseudonym  lyadov   many of these had aliases that originated out of necessity in their past underground life   but what had compelled the likes of shotman  the socialist revolutionary from tomsk   and not him alone  to become  danilov  in       certainly  the goal of a revolutionary  hiding behind a pseudonym  is to outsmart someone  and that may include not only the police and government  in this way  ordinary people as well are unable to figure out who their new leaders are  intoxicated by the freedom of the first months of the february revolution  many jewish activists and orators failed to notice that their constant fussing around presidiums and rallies produced certain bewilderment and wry glances  by the time of the february revolution there was no  popular anti semitism  in the internal regions of russia  it was confined exclusively to the areas of the pale of settlement   for instance  abraham cogan had even stated in        we loved russia despite all the oppression from the previous regime because we knew that it was not the russian people  behind it but tsarism       but after just a few months following the february revolution  resentment against jews had suddenly flared up among the masses of people and spread over russia  growing stronger with each passing month  and even the official newspapers reported  for instance  on the exasperation in the waiting lines in the cities   everything has been changed in that twinkle of the eye that created a chasm between the old and the new russia  but it is queues that have changed the most  strangely  while everything has moved to the left  the food lines have moved to the right  if you     would like to hear black hundred propaganda     then go and spend some time in a waiting line   among other things you will find out that  there are virtually no jews in the lines  they don t need it as they have enough bread hoarded   the same  gossip about jews who tuck away bread  rolls from another end of the line as well   the waiting lines is the most dangerous source of counterrevolution       the author ivan nazhivin noted that in the autumn in moscow anti semitic propaganda fell on ready ears in the hungry revolutionary queues   what rascals      they wormed themselves onto the very top      see  how proudly they ride in their cars     sure  not a single yid can be found in the lines here     just you wait       any revolution releases a flood of filth  envy  and anger from the people  the same happened among the russian people  with their weakened christian spirituality  and so the jews   many of whom had ascended to the top  to visibility  and  what is more  who had not concealed their revolutionary jubilation  nor waited in the miserable lines   increasingly became a target of popular resentment  many instances of such resentment were documented in      newspapers  below are several examples  when  at the apraksin market on sennaya square  a hoard of goods was discovered in possession of jewish merchants   people began shout      plunder jewish shops    because  yids are responsible for all the troubles      and this word  yid  is on everyone s lips       a stockpile of flour and bacon was found in the store of a merchant  likely a jew  in poltava  the crowd started plundering his shop and then began calling for a jewish pogrom  later  several members of the soviet of workers  deputies  including drobnis  arrived and attempted to appease the crowd  as a result  drobnis was beaten      in october in ekaterinoslav soldiers trashed small shops  shouting  smash the bourgeois  smash the yids   in kiev at the vladimirsky market a boy had hit a woman  who tried to buy flour out her turn on the head instantly  the crowd started yelling  the yids are beating the russians   and a brawl ensued   note that it had happened in the same kiev where one could already see the streamers  long live free ukraine without yids and poles    by that time  smash the yids   could be heard in almost every street brawl  even in petrograd  and often completely without foundation  for instance  in a petrograd streetcar two women  called for disbanding of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies  filled  according to them  exclusively by  germans and yids   both were arrested and called to account       newspaper russkaya volya  russian freedom  reported   right in front of our eyes  anti semitism  in its most primitive form     re arises and spreads     it is enough to hear to conversations in streetcars  in petrograd  or in waiting lines to various shops  or in the countless fleeting rallies at every corner and crossroad     they accuse jews of political stranglehold  of seizing parties and soviets  and even of ruining the army     of looting and hoarding goods       many jewish socialists  agitators in the front units  enjoyed unlimited success during the spring months when calls for a  democratic peace  were tolerated and fighting was not required  then nobody blamed them for being jewish  but in june when the policy of the executive committee had changed toward support and even propaganda for the offensive  calls of  smash the yids   began appearing and those jewish persuaders suffered battering by unruly soldiers time and time again  rumors were spreading that the executive committee in petrograd was  seized by yids   by june this belief had taken root in the petrograd garrison and factories  this is exactly what soldiers shouted to the member of the committee voitinsky who had visited an infantry regiment to dissuade the troops from the looming demonstration conceived by bolsheviks on june     by autumn  the activity of jews in power had created such an effect that even iskry  sparks   the illustrated supplement to the surpassingly gentle russkoe slovo  russian word  that would until then never dare defying public opinion in such a way  had published an abrasive anti jewish caricature in the october    issue  that is  already during fights of the october coup in moscow  the executive committee of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies actively fought against anti semitism   i cannot rule out that the harsh refusal to accept the well deserved plekhanov into the cec in april      was a kind of revenge for his anti bund referral to the  tribe of gad   which was mentioned in lenin s publications     indeed  i cannot provide any other explanation   on july    the  st all russian congress of soviets had issued a proclamation about a struggle against anti semitism   about the only resolution approved by the congress unanimously  without any objections or arguments        when in the end of june    th and   th  the re elected bureau of the cec had assembled  they had heard a report on  the rise of anti semitic agitation     mainly in the northwestern and southwestern  guberniyas  a decision was made immediately to send a delegation of    members of the cec with special powers there      subordinating them to the direction of the  department on the struggle against counter revolution   on the other hand  bolsheviks  who advanced their agenda under the slogan  down with the ministers capitalists   not only did nothing to alleviate this problem  they even fanned its flames  along with the anarchists  despite the fact that the latter were headed by one bleikhman   they claimed that the executive committee was so exceptionally lenient toward the government only because capitalists and jews control everything  isn t that reminiscent of narodnaya volya  the people s will terrorist organization  of         and when the bolshevik uprising of july     broke out  it was in fact targeted not against the already impotent provisional government but against the bolshevik s true competitor   executive committee   the bolsheviks slyly exploited the anger of soldiers toward jews by pointing them to that very body   see  there they are  but when the bolsheviks had lost their uprising  the cec had conducted an official investigation and many members of the commission of inquiry were jews from the presidium of the cec  and because of their  socialist conscience  they dared not call the bolshevik uprising a crime and deal with it accordingly  so the commission had yielded no result and was soon liquidated  during the garrison meeting  arranged by the cec on october     just before the decisive bolshevik uprising   one of representatives of    th infantry regiment  a jew   warned that  those people down on the streets scream that jews are responsible for all the wrongs       at the cec meeting during the night of october     gendelman reported that when he was giving a speech in the peter and paul fortress earlier that afternoon he was taunted   you are gendelman  that is you are a yid and a rightist       when on october    gotz and his delegation to kerensky tried to depart to gatchina from the baltiysky rail terminal  he was nearly killed by sailors who screamed that  the soviets are controlled by yids       and during the  wine pogroms  on the eve of the  glorious bolshevik victory   the calls  slaughter yids   were heard also  and yet there was not a single jewish pogrom over the whole year of       the infamous outrageous pogroms in kalusha and ternopol were in fact the work of frenzied drunken revolutionary soldiers  retreating in disorder  they smashed everything on their way  all shops and stores  and because most of those were jewish owned  the word spread about  jewish pogroms   a similar pogrom took place in stanislavov  with its much smaller jewish population  and quite reasonably it was not labeled a  jewish  pogrom  already by the mid summer of      the jews felt threatened by the embittered population  or drunken soldiers   but the ongoing collapse of the state was fraught with incomparably greater dangers  amazingly  it seems that both the jewish community and the press  the latter to a large extent identified with the former  learned nothing from the formidable experiences of      in general  but narrowly looked at the  isolated manifestations of pogroms   and so time after time they missed the real danger  the executive power behaved similarly  when the germans breached the front at ternopol in the night of july     the desperate joint meeting of the cec of the soviet of workers  and soldiers  deputies and the executive committee of the soviet of peasants  deputies had taken place  they had acknowledged that should the revolution perish  the country crumbles down  in that exact order   and then named provisional government a  government for salvation of the revolution   and noted in their appeal to the people that  dark forces are again prepared to torment our longsuffering motherland  they are setting backward masses upon the jews       on july    at a panel session of the state duma  in an extremely small circle  rep  maslennikov spoke against the executive committee and among other things spelled out the real names of its members  on the very same evening at the factional meeting of the cec they beat an alarm   this is a case of counterrevolution  it must be dealt with according to the recently issued decree of the minister of internal affairs tsereteli on suppression of counterrevolution   the decree was issued in response to the bolshevik uprising  though it was never used against bolsheviks   in two days maslennikov made excuses in an article in the newspaper rech  speech   indeed  he named steklov  kamenev  and trotsky but never intended to incite anger against the entire jewish people  and  anyway  attacking them  i had absolutely no wish to make jewish people responsible for the actions of these individuals       then  in mid september  when the all gains of the february revolution were already irreversibly ruined  on the eve of the by now imminent bolshevik coup  ya  kantorovich warned in rech about the danger that   the dark forces and evil geniuses of russia will soon emerge from their dens to jubilantly perform black masses      indeed  it will happen soon  yet what kind of black masses        of bestial patriotism and pogrom loving  truly russian  national identity       in october in petrograd i  trumpeldor had organized jewish self defense forces for protection against pogroms  but they were never needed  several years after the revolution  g  landau  looking back with sadness  wrote   jewish participation in the russian turmoil had astonishingly suicidal overtones in it  i am referring not only to their role in bolshevism  but to their involvement in the whole thing  and it is not just about the huge number of politically active people  socialists and revolutionaries  who have joined the revolution  i am talking mainly about the broad sympathy of the masses it was met with     although many harbored pessimistic expectations  in particular  an anticipation of pogroms  they were still able to reconcile such a foreboding with an acceptance of turmoil which unleashed countless miseries and pogroms  it resembled the fatal attraction of butterflies to fire  to the annihilating fire     it is certain there were some strong motives pushing the jews into that direction  and yet those were clearly suicidal     granted  jews were not different in that from the rest of russian intelligentsia and from the russian society     yet we had to be different     we  the ancient people of city dwellers  merchants  artisans  intellectuals     we had to be different from the people of land and power  from peasants  landowners  officials       and let s not forget those who were different  we must always remember that jewry was and is very heterogeneous  that attitudes and actions vary greatly among the jews  so it was with the russian jewry in       in provinces and even in the capital there were circles with reasonable views and they were growing as october was getting closer  the jewish stance toward russian unity during the months when russia was pulled apart not only by other nations  but even by siberians  was remarkable   all over the course of revolution jews  together with great russians  were among the most ardent champions of the idea of great russia       now  when jews had gotten their equal rights  what could they have in common with different peoples on the periphery of the former empire  and yet the disintegration of a united country would fracture jewry  in july at the  th congress of constitutional democrats  vinaver and nolde openly argued against territorial partition of peoples and in favor of russian unity      also in september  in the national section of the democratic conference  the jewish socialists spoke against any federalization of russia  in that they had joined the centralists   today they write in an israeli magazine that trumpeldor s jewish detachments  backed the provisional government and had even foiled the kornilov s mutiny       perhaps  however  in rigorously studying events of       i did not encounter any such information  but i am aware of opposite instances  in early may      in the thundering patriotic and essentially counter revolutionary  black sea delegation   the most successful orator calling for the defense of russia was jewish sailor batkin  d  pasmanik had published the letters of millionaire steamship owner shulim bespalov to the minister of trade and industry shakhovsky dated as early as september        excessive profits made by all industrialists and traders lead our motherland to the imminent wreck   he had donated half a million rubles to the state and proposed to establish a law limiting all profits by      unfortunately  these self restricting measures were not introduced as  rush to freedom  progressives  such as konovalov and ryabushinsky  did not mind making      war profits  when konovalov himself became the minister of trade and industry  shulim bespalov wrote to him on july           excessive profits of industrialists are ruining our country  now we must take     of the value of their capitals and property   and added that he is ready to part with     of his own assets  konovalov paid no heed      in august  at the moscow all russian state conference  o  o  gruzenberg  a future member of the constituent assembly  stated   these days the jewish people     are united in their allegiance to our motherland  in unanimous aspiration to defend her integrity and achievements of democracy  and were prepared to give for her defense  all their material and intellectual assets  to part with everything precious  with the flower of their people  all their young       these words reflected the realization that the february regime was the best for the russian jewry  promising economic progress as well as political and cultural prosperity  and that realization was adequate  the closer it got to to october coup and the more apparent the bolshevik threat  the wider this realization spread among jews  leading them to oppose bolshevism  it was taking root even among socialist parties and during the october coup many jewish socialists were actively against it  yet they were debilitated by their socialist views and their opposition was limited by negotiations and newspaper articles   until the bolsheviks shut down those newspapers  it is necessary to state explicitly that the october coup was not carried by jews  though it was under the general command of trotsky and with energetic actions of young grigory chudnovsky during the arrest of provisional government and the massacre of the defenders of the winter palace   broadly speaking  the common rebuke  that the     million people could not be pushed into bolshevism by a small jewish minority  is justified  indeed  we had ourselves sealed our fate in       through our foolishness from february to october december  the october coup proved a devastating lot for russia  yet the state of affairs even before it promised little good to the people  we had already lost responsible statesmanship and the events of      had proved it in excess  the best russia could expect was an inept  feeble  and disorderly pseudo democracy  unable to rely on enough citizens with developed legal consciousness and economic independence  after october fights in moscow  representatives of the bund and poale zion had taken part in the peace negotiations   not in alliance with the junkers or the bolsheviks    but as a third independent party  there were many jews among junkers of the engineers school who defended the winter palace on october     in the memoirs of sinegub  a palace defender  jewish names appear regularly  i personally knew one such engineer from my prison experience  and during the odessa city duma elections the jewish block had opposed the bolsheviks and won  though only marginally  during the constituent assembly elections  more than     of jewish population in russia had voted  for zionist parties      lenin wrote that     thousands voted for jewish nationalists       most jewish parties have formed a united national list of candidates  seven deputies were elected from that list   six zionists  and gruzenberg  the success of zionists was facilitated by the recently published declaration of british minister of foreign affairs balfour on the establishment of  jewish national home  in palestine  which was  met with enthusiasm by the majority of russian jewry  celebratory demonstrations  rallies and worship services took place in moscow  petrograd  odessa  kiev and many other cities        prior to the october coup  bolshevism was not very influential among jews  but just before the uprising  natanson  kamkov  and shteinberg on behalf of the left socialist revolutionaries had signed a combat pact with bolsheviks trotsky and kamenev      and some jews distinguished themselves among the bolsheviks in their very first victories and some even became famous  the commissar of the famed latvian regiments of the   th army  which did so much for the success of bolshevik coup  was semyon nakhimson   jewish soldiers played a notable role during preparation and execution of the armed uprising of october      in petrograd and other cities  and also during suppression of mutinies and armed resurrections against the new soviet regime       it is widely known that during the  historical  session of the congress of soviets on october    two acts  the  decree on land  and the  decree on peace   were passed  but it didn t leave a mark in history that after the  decree on peace  but before the  decree on land  another resolution was passed  it declared it  a matter of honor for local soviets to prevent jewish and any other pogroms by dark forces       pogroms by  red forces of light  were not anticipated   so even here  at the congress of workers  and peasants  deputies  the jewish question was put ahead of the peasant one \n",

            "Debug Text -  we ve been having quite the spirited discussion in the comments section to a recent post   ravenstahl  birth control    the  th ward democratic committee meeting   one commenter  patrick  and i have been going back and forth and my answer to his latest comment grew so long that i thought that it deserved a post of its own   you can read all the comments here   here s patrick s latest comment  at      pm  patrick said    look  this is really getting old    but the posts i ve read which claim to quote luke on the bubble law are referencing questions from committee people on the subject of birth control  those questions then went on to tie in his opposition to the bubble law as a way to sound him out on the right to privacy  seems to me like the questioners were trying to ask about his views on abortion  without actually asking about his views on abortion   thus  luke s responses to those multi subject questions would naturally mention privacy   the questioners asked him about it themselves  i have yet to see references in these blogs of a question directed at luke that specifically asked about why he voted no on the bubble law   now  one can believe in a right to privacy and still be of the opinion that roe v  wade was wrongly decided  but that s another set of blog posts     and another thing  why do the residents of peduto stan seem so desperate to believe that luke is against birth control and abortion  does that somehow give their support of peduto some extra value  maybe it s more motivation to be against someone rather than be for your own candidate  but the peduto istas seem to want luke to be against everything they believe in  perhaps so it feels better backing peduto  note  in a previous comment  patrick had asserted the following   opposing this bubble law is in no way an attempt to repeal these existing laws  rather it is a solid  pro american  pro  st amendment stand that luke should be commended for taking   here s my reply  patrick  your denial is what s getting old  you ascribe positions and opinions to ravenstahl with absolutely no backup    without one shred of evidence  i  on the other hand  believe ravenstahl when he tells people that he s against birth control and when he tells the post gazette that he s  socially conservative   it s really quite simple  patrick  if he voted against the bubble zone based on the first amendment  why doesn t he just say that  he had all the time in the world to give his justifications during the vote  yet he chose to be the only council member to remain silent about why he voted as he did  when someone asks him a question like  mayor ravenstahl  i m concerned about your position on contraceptives abortion privacy rights because of your  no  vote on the bubble zone  can you help me out on that   he could just say something like   my vote reflected my first amendment concerns   damn  that was pretty friggin  simple  no  only seven words  yet  time after time  he doesn t say anything like that  this has to lead one to believe that either     he didn t vote based on that or     for some reason he wants people to think it may have been based on his religious views moral concerns but he s being cagey about it or     what    he just can t even think that much on his feet  i mean come on  it s not that hard to say what you mean  is it  but  i have no doubt that if this issue breaks into the msm  and he starts taking some heat on it  he will have no trouble flip flopping  after all  that s been his mo  as the p g s brian o neill has pointed out   a couple of years ago  councilman ravenstahl wanted to stop devoting bus shelter advertising revenue to shade trees  this month  mayor ravensthal is pledging to slash carbon dioxide pollution and has signed the u s  mayors climate protection agreement  last fall  mayor ravenstahl lobbied to keep a     lump sum tax on all workers inside the city limits  last month  he changed his mind  advocating the same    a week system peduto has pushed  last october  mayor ravenstahl nominated the politically toxic dennis regan to be public safety director  after that choice went over like a browns jersey at a steelers tailgate party  the mayor nominated fire chief mike huss as director of public safety  the same guy councilman peduto suggested in october   however  o neill loses me when he says    who can argue that learning from early mistakes is a bad trait in a politician   because what i ve also seen from ravenstahl is lots and lots of plain old bad judgment and some folks just never outgrow that  bush is prime example of that   ravenstahl has shown plenty of incredibly poor judgment  he demonstrated that trait when he raised the  politically toxic  dennis regan to be his director of operations  it got even worse when he named him as pittsburgh s public safety director  even a    year old should know that that position demanded experience    hell  even an    year old should have known that  his declaration that cathy mcneilly wasn t a whistle blower and the demotion that followed will cost the city big time  his killing off of the police off duty recovery program will  and has  cost the city even more  there was also his failure to really reform city council spending when he  instead  opted to keep the walking around monies and  for someone who s running against bill peduto  he sure has no problem  borrowing  idea after idea from him  or  just outright claiming credit for work he never did  and  i don t think he even bothers do the borrowing on his own  i hear it s yarone zober s job to grab into the bag of  things peduto has said during council meetings  to come up with ideas for ravenstahl to parrot  and  when he isn t busy pirating from peduto  he s stumped for answers on something as big as the mon fayette project or he  the mayor of pittsburgh  is conceding his authority to his  boss   boss  why do we need to keep asking who s in charge with this guy  then there s his problem with being more inclined to truthiness than truth    yeah  i have a problem with people who weasel or lie  i also have a problem with blatant use of taxpayer dollars for one s own politcal gain  and after all this  i m supposed to support luke       why  no  really  why  i mean even he wasn t able to come up with an answer on that his own self for david letterman  as to your assertion that   maybe it s more motivation to be against someone rather than be for your own candidate  but the peduto istas seem to want luke to be against everything they believe in  perhaps so it feels better backing peduto   i don t need any help in feeling good about backing bill peduto for mayor  thank you very much  i backed him in his first run in      and i support him now for the same reasons that i supported him then  i m supporting bill peduto for mayor because i find him to be smart  knowledgeable  experienced  and creative  i believe that he possesses the good judgment necessary to more than handle this important position  i also happen to agree with his stance on many issues  moreover  i know that i don t have to worry that he s beholden to the same old  same old  tired crew of the worst of the party hacks  when peduto speaks as mayor  he won t need to look around to others for an answer as to his opinions on the important issues of the day  and we won t have to ask who s the boss  that s why i m for bill \n",

            "Debug Text -  jack kelly   tackles the   nie  in today s p g  and  as usual  he spins and misdirects  he also completely misses the point  but before we try to deconstruct j kel yet again  let s just take a look at how the nie describes its own construction  if only to head off the inevitable righwing talking point that it was written by   disgruntled former state department officials   here it is  page   of the estimate  national intelligence estimates  nies  are the intelligence community s  ic  most authoritative written judgments on national security issues and designed to help us civilian and military leaders develop policies to protect us national security interests  nies usually provide information on the current state of play but are primarily  estimative  that is  they make judgments about the likely course of future events and identify the implications for us policy  the nies are typically requested by senior civilian and military policymakers  congressional leaders and at times are initiated by the national intelligence council  nic   before a nie is drafted  the relevant nio is responsible for producing a concept paper or terms of reference  tor  and circulates it throughout the intelligence community for comment  the tor defines the key estimative questions  determines drafting responsibilities  and sets the drafting and publication schedule  one or more ic analysts are usually assigned to produce the initial text  the nic then meets to critique the draft before it is circulated to the broader ic  representatives from the relevant ic agencies meet to hone and coordinate line by line the full text of the nie  working with their agencies  reps also assign the level of confidence they have in each key judgment  ic reps discuss the quality of sources with collectors  and the national clandestine service vets the sources used to ensure the draft does not include any that have been recalled or otherwise seriously questioned  all nies are reviewed by national intelligence board  which is chaired by the dni and is composed of the heads of relevant ic agencies  once approved by the nib  nies are briefed to the president and senior policymakers  the whole process of producing nies normally takes at least several months  ok now that that s done  let s get down to business  here s how commando kelly begins  iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in      and probably won t be able to build a bomb before      if it does restart it  a new national intelligence estimate has concluded  that s very good news     if it s true  but that s a big if  the nie is a swag  scientific wild assed guess   not a statement of proven fact  it s a swag from an intelligence community whose predictive record about the middle east has been poor  it s a swag that s challenged by israeli intelligence  whose predictive history is much better  and it s a swag that is diametrically opposed to the last swag the intelligence community issued on iran s nuclear program  not that big  if you read how the thing was put together  jack is relying on the rhetorical device that goes something like this  they were wrong before so why should we believe them now  turns out that the answer to that has been written into the current nie  the nic has undertaken a number of steps to improve the nie process under the dni  these steps are in accordance with the goals and recommendations set out in the ssci and wmd commission reports and the      intelligence reform and prevention of terrorism act  most notably  over the last year and a half  the ic has  created new procedures to integrate formal reviews of source reporting and technical judgments  the directors of the national clandestine service  nsa  nga  and dia and the assistant secretary inr are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths  weaknesses  and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the nie  applied more rigorous standards  a textbox is incorporated into all nies that explains what we mean by such terms as  we judge  and that clarifies the difference between judgments of likelihood and confidence levels  we have made a concerted effort to not only highlight differences among agencies but to explain the reasons for such differences and to prominently display them in the key judgments  we ve written on this before  but it might be a good idea to go over this again  how  or at least why  did they change their minds on this  here s something  again  from the washington post  a pivotal moment occurred in early summer       when president bush discussed the new iran nie with advisers during a routine intelligence briefing  why  he asked  was it so hard to get information about iran s nuclear program  the exchange  described by a senior u s  official who witnessed it  helped instigate the intelligence community s most aggressive attempt to penetrate iran s highly secretive nuclear program  over the coming months  the cia established a new iran operations division that brought analysts and clandestine collectors together to search for hard evidence  communications intercepts of iranian nuclear officials and a stolen iranian laptop containing diagrams related to the development of a nuclear warhead for missiles both yielded valuable evidence about iran s nuclear past as well as its decision in      to suspend the weapons side of its program  but there was no  eureka  moment  according to senior officials who helped supervise the collection efforts  the surge in intelligence gathering helped convince analysts that iran had made a  course correction  in       halting the weapons work while proceeding with the civilian nuclear energy program  the result  ironically  was a new national intelligence estimate on iran that reached conclusions far different from what many intelligence officials expected  so here we have the president asking why it was so hard to get good evidence on the iranian nuclear program and that spurred on the intelligence community to take a closer look at the data at hand  when they looked harder  they reassessed what they saw  the result was the latest nie  and dni mcconnell had a different methodology in place as well  again  from the washington post  former and current intelligence officials say the new nie reflects new analytical methods ordered by mcconnell    who took the dni job in january    and his deputies  including thomas fingar  a former head of the state department s intelligence agency  and donald m  kerr  a former director of the los alamos national laboratory and an expert on nuclear weapons technology  besides requiring greater transparency about the sources of intelligence  mcconnell and his colleagues have compelled analysts working on major estimates to challenge existing assumptions when new information does not fit  according to former and current u s  officials familiar with the policies  then there s this from the new york times  american intelligence agencies reversed their view about the status of iran s nuclear weapons program after they obtained notes last summer from the deliberations of iranian military officials involved in the weapons development program  senior intelligence and government officials said on wednesday  so  different data  different methology  why shouldn t there be a different conclusion  jack  then  kinda  pushes the  disinformation  button only to  kinda  slap it away a paragraph later  but what if the notes were disinformation planted to mislead us  it was uncorroborated statements which proved to be false from an iraqi defector  curveball  which were chiefly responsible for the intelligence community s apparently erroneous conclusions about saddam s weapons of mass destruction  the notes and deliberations were corroborated by other intelligence  including intercepted telephone conversations among iranian officials  sources told the new york times  ah  curveball  the gift that keeps on giving  too bad that curveball  aka rafid ahmed alwan  wasn t a direct intelligence source for the us  he was controlled by the germans who did not permit us intelligence any access to him  before dubya s war  the head of german intelligence even tried to warn off us intelligence about him  calling him  crazy  and a  waste of time   but this administration needed a reason to go to war and curveball gave it to them  he was a part of the administration s lies leading up to the war  but back to whether the nie was based on another  curveball   this is how the new york times described it  but they said that the central intelligence agency and other agencies had organized a  red team  to determine if the new information might have been part of an elaborate disinformation campaign mounted by iran to derail the effort to impose sanctions against it  in the end  american intelligence officials rejected that theory  though they were challenged to defend that conclusion in a meeting two weeks ago in the white house situation room  in which the notes and deliberations were described to the most senior members of president bush s national security team  including vice president dick cheney   it was a pretty vivid exchange   said one participant in the conversation  the officials said they were confident that the notes confirmed the existence  up to       of a weapons programs that american officials first learned about from a laptop computer  belonging to an iranian engineer  that came into the hands of the c i a  in       no wonder jack boiled down that meeting  with its  vivid exchange   to one bland sentence  it shows that dick cheney knew about the nie by the third week of november  which leads me to the point that jack kelly  former national security correspondent to the pittsburgh post gazette insisted on missing in his entire column  the story is not only about the nie  but about when the highest levels of the administration knew about it  they ve known for months what it said and yet continued to warn  as they did on october     about iran  nuclear weapons  and world war iii  as scott horton wrote about the timing of the release of the nie and whether week old intelligence was at the heart of it at harpers  is this true  that will be a subject for further study  but one highly reliable intelligence community source i consulted immediately after hadley spoke answered my question this way   this is absolutely absurd  the nie has been in substantially the form in which it was finally submitted for more than six months  the white house  and particularly vice president cheney  used every trick in the book to stop it from being finalized and issued  there was no last minute breakthrough that caused the issuance of the assessment   that  jack  was the point of all this  another lie from this administration that would lead to more needless death and destruction  this time  though  they got caught before anyone got hurt \n",

out butler county exurbs  has spent more than a decade slogging his way toward power  for years  he was a nobody in harrisburg  and the media paid far more attention to his strong worded comments about gays  guns and immigrants than his colleagues ever did to his legislation  but in the wake of president barack obama s election  things changed  a national movement of angry conservatives took hold and voted out any republicans or democrats who smelled of moderation  or  as metcalfe put it to the liberal news website talking points memo   i was a tea partier before it was cool   here s that tpm piece on him  in it  there s this about metcalfe  metcalfe says he s a dyed in the wool conservative  he told me  i was a tea partier before it was cool   and promises to fight his own party if necessary to maintain purity on issues like gun rights  tax reduction and  keeping marriage between a man and a woman   last october  metcalfe landed in hot water after he called veterans who support global climate change treaties  traitors to their oaths to uphold the constitution   but back to the philycp  there s this defining his legislative power  metcalfe is now chairman of the powerful state government committee  and he s savoring the political moment  he was a key supporter of an expansion of gun owners  rights to fire on an assailant  a bill signed by gov  tom corbett  the house passed metcalfe s legislation requiring voters to present government identification  which could disproportionately keep the poor  elderly and nonwhite from the polls  this fall  he is expected to move legislation to pass a constitutional amendment barring same sex marriage  anti immigrant measures modeled on arizona s draconian law  and an anti union  right to work  bill that corbett pledges to sign  crucially  metcalfe  who did not return repeated requests for comment  will help oversee the decennial process of redrawing congressional districts to reflect population changes from the      census  he wields enormous power to reshape districts and  thus  elections  for years to come  and this on his gay agenda  metcalfe is the house s most prominent critic of gays  he opposed philly s program to market the city to gay tourists  saying that tax dollars should not be used to  promote immoral behaviors   he tried to cut state funding to universities such as temple because they offer domestic partner benefits  he sued a gay new hope couple for attempting  and failing  to get a marriage license  and he opposed domestic violence awareness month  calling it part of  the homosexual agenda  to support a  sinful lifestyle  because it recognized male victims of rape   the gentleman from butler has made this problem even worse and more men may be abused  even killed in their homes   decried rep  babette josephs  a democrat from philadelphia  on the house floor in       all that really fun stuff aside  here s where some ongoing threads intertwine once again  it s all about daryl and alec  like many right wing state legislators nationwide  daryl metcalfe is a member of the american legislative exchange council  alec   which produces model legislation drafted in part by big business  this year  alec has come under criticism for its role in pushing legislation like wisconsin s anti union bill  what s surprising is that pennsylvania taxpayers pick up the tab for metcalfe s involvement  documents obtained by city paper from the pennsylvania state ethics commission show that alec reimbursed metcalfe         in       a  scholarship  that is funded by major corporations  and state documents obtained by good government group common cause and reviewed by city paper reveal that taxpayers also reimbursed metcalfe         in per diems  and for parking and transportation  food and other fees for the      alec conference in philadelphia  since       taxpayers have footed        in alec expenses for the self professed small government advocate  he isn t the only republican steering taxpayer dollars to the conservative advocacy group   other legislators also had fees and per diems covered  that same year  the documents also show that a         appropriation to cater the alec meeting was added into the state budget  a food bill footed by taxpayers that included         in roasted chicken breast and        for cheesecake lollipops  the budget outlay was described as  for the payment of expenses related to hosting conferences  meetings or conventions of multistage organizations which protect the member states  interests or which promote governmental financial excellence or accountability   metcalfe s agenda more or less mirrors that of alec model legislation  including efforts to compel local police to enforce immigration laws and prohibit localities like philly from enacting their own gun restrictions  daryl and alec  sittin  in a tree  k i s s i n g   \n",

assist in achieving the shared objective of the congress and the president  evidenced in title x  of protecting the american people from further terrorist attacks  further  in light of the principles enunciated by the supreme court of the united states in      in alexander v  sandoval  and noting that the text and structure of title x do not create a private right of action to enforce title x  the executive branch shall construe title x not to create a private right of action  finally  given the decision of the congress reflected in subsections      e  and      h  that the amendments made to section      of title     united states code  shall apply to past  present  and future actions  including applications for writs of habeas corpus  described in that section  and noting that section      does not confer any constitutional right upon an alien detained abroad as an enemy combatant  the executive branch shall construe section      to preclude the federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future action  including applications for writs of habeas corpus  described in section       you may need to read that twice to get a better idea of what s in there  but here s how charlie savage of the boston globe described what bush did  when president bush last week signed the bill outlawing the torture of detainees  he quietly reserved the right to bypass the law under his powers as commander in chief  after approving the bill last friday  bush issued a   signing statement     an official document in which a president lays out his interpretation of a new law    declaring that he will view the interrogation limits in the context of his broader powers to protect national security  this means bush believes he can waive the restrictions  the white house and legal specialists said  though they try to reassure the skittish terrorist enablers    we are not going to ignore this law   the official said  noting that bush  when signing laws  routinely issues signing statements saying he will construe them consistent with his own constitutional authority    we consider it a valid statute  we consider ourselves bound by the prohibition on cruel  unusual  and degrading treatment   but  the official said  a situation could arise in which bush may have to waive the law s restrictions to carry out his responsibilities to protect national security  he cited as an example a   ticking time bomb  scenario  in which a detainee is believed to have information that could prevent a planned terrorist attack  not that means much  david golove  a new york university law professor who specializes in executive power issues  said that the signing statement means that bush believes he can still authorize harsh interrogation tactics when he sees fit    the signing statement is saying  i will only comply with this law when i want to  and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think it s important to torture or engage in cruel  inhuman  and degrading conduct  i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me     he said    they don t want to come out and say it directly because it doesn t sound very nice  but it s unmistakable to anyone who has been following what s going on   interestingly  something savage writes in the very next paragraph also resonates this story  golove and other legal specialists compared the signing statement to bush s decision  revealed last month  to bypass a      law forbidding domestic wiretapping without a warrant  bush authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on americans  international phone calls and e mails without a court order starting after the terrorist attacks of sept            authorizing previously unauthorized nsa eavesdropping  ignoring laws banning the torture of human beings  anyone remember those offenses  jack  don t you  and yet when the obama administration delays by a year the implementation of a section of the affordable healthcare act  that s when the conservatives from maine to malibu judge as the time to point out the president s legal obligations under article ii  oh  the hypocrisy \n",

            "Debug Text -  from cbs news  the united states tortured al qaeda detainees captured after the sept          attacks  president obama acknowledged friday  in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of cia practices that he banned after taking office  from the white house transcript  i have full confidence in john brennan  i think he has acknowledged and directly apologized to senator feinstein that cia personnel did not properly handle an investigation as to how certain documents that were not authorized to be released to the senate staff got somehow into the hands of the senate staff  and it s clear from the ig report that some very poor judgment was shown in terms of how that was handled  keep in mind  though  that john brennan was the person who called for the ig report  and he s already stood up a task force to make sure that lessons are learned and mistakes are resolved  with respect to the larger point of the rdi report itself  even before i came into office i was very clear that in the immediate aftermath of      we did some things that were wrong  we did a whole lot of things that were right  but we tortured some folks  we did some things that were contrary to our values  i understand why it happened  i think it s important when we look back to recall how afraid people were after the twin towers fell and the pentagon had been hit and the plane in pennsylvania had fallen  and people did not know whether more attacks were imminent  and there was enormous pressure on our law enforcement and our national security teams to try to deal with this  and it s important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had  and a lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots  but having said all that  we did some things that were wrong  and that s what that report reflects  and that s the reason why  after i took office  one of the first things i did was to ban some of the extraordinary interrogation techniques that are the subject of that report  let s start with brennan  what he acknowledged was  in fact  his own dishonesty  but i m getting a little ahead of myself  let s take a step back  there s an ongoing dispute in dc about the cia s rendition  detention and interrogation  rdi  program  the senate intelligence committee s written a report that s now circulating behind the locked doors of official washington and a summary of it is  supposedly  on its way to being declassified and released  the white house in the next few days is expected to declassify the long awaited summary of a u s  senate committee study of a cia program that used  enhanced interrogations  and secret prisons to extract information from captured militants  several officials familiar with the matter said  over the last two weeks  former directors and deputy directors of the cia have been invited by the obama administration to review a still secret version of the     page senate intelligence committee summary at the office of the director of national intelligence  officials familiar with its contents say it concludes that the cia s use of harsh  enhanced interrogation  methods such as waterboarding  or simulated drowning  on a handful of prisoners  and other stress tactics on a larger set of captured militants  did not produce any significant counter terrorism breakthroughs in the years after the sept            attacks on new york and washington  human rights activists and cia critics  including some u s  politicians  have described the cia s techniques as torture  the officials said the report also alleges that cia officials misstated or exaggerated the results of the program by claiming such methods had helped to foil terrorist plots  so according to those who ve seen the report  the cia tortured and then lied about the effectiveness of that torture  the point here is that while the senate was investigating the cia s torturous rdi program  the senate intelligence committee was actually spied on by the cia  here s what brennan said early on to andrea mitchell of nbc news  as far as the allegations of the cia hacking into senate computers  nothing could be further from the truth  that s just beyond the scope of reason  and that turns out to be completely and unquestionably false  from cnn  cia director john brennan apologized to the senate intelligence committee on thursday and admitted the agency spied on computers used by its staffers who prepared an investigation of the controversial post      cia interrogation and detention program  so that s how the dcia and the cia lied to everybody about the rdi program  now that we ve established that  what s the bigger issue  because no matter how the president frames it  torture is still illegal  from the united nations convention against torture  article i  for the purposes of this convention  torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession  punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed  or intimidating or coercing him or a third person  or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind  when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity  it does not include pain or suffering arising only from  inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions  and now something from article ii  no exceptional circumstances whatsoever  whether a state of war or a threat or war  internal political instability or any other public emergency  may be invoked as a justification of torture  see  no matter how bad      was  no matter how scared the people were  there s no justification to torture  it s simply against the law   international law  let me add a footnote  torture s illegal according to this more recent law as well  this was introduced by senator john mccain as an amendment to a larger appropriations bill   it was later signed into law by george w  bush   no individual in the custody or under the physical control of the united states government  regardless of nationality or physical location  shall be subject to cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment  and so on  of course  this was in the age of the previous  and oh so republican  administration  the age of the unitary executive  when a president could sign a bill into law and then claim that it didn t always have to apply to him  from the boston globe in       when president bush last week signed the bill outlawing the torture of detainees  he quietly reserved the right to bypass the law under his powers as commander in chief  after approving the bill last friday  bush issued a   signing statement     an official document in which a president lays out his interpretation of a new law    declaring that he will view the interrogation limits in the context of his broader powers to protect national security  this means bush believes he can waive the restrictions  the white house and legal specialists said    the executive branch shall construe  the law  in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president       as commander in chief   bush wrote  adding that this approach   will assist in achieving the shared objective of the congress and the president       of protecting the american people from further terrorist attacks   meaning  david golove  a new york university law professor who specializes in executive power issues  said that the signing statement means that bush believes he can still authorize harsh interrogation tactics when he sees fit  it s interesting that there wasn t much of a peep then from today s impeachment crowd  back then a  republican  president was claiming the authority to side step international laws barring war crimes and there s more or less silence from the right wing  now a  democratic  president issues an executive order rearranging some parts of the implementation of a law getting more americans affordable health care and bam  suddenly there s a constitutional crisis on the  pro life  right  the sad sad part about all this is that the current  democratic  president is letting the previous  republican  president get away with war crimes  i m just wondering when fox news will call for obama s impeachment for the crime of giving bush s waterboarding a pass \n",

            "Debug Text -  i ve been meaning to write about this story for some time  in case you missed them  here are the details  allegheny county council will get its turn to decide if its quarters in the county courthouse should display the words  in god we trust   at a committee on government reform meeting thursday night  the group decided     to present council at its sept    meeting with an amended resolution that would display that motto  among others  on a plaque in the gold room  located on the fourth floor of the courthouse      grant st  the other mottoes  as added by amendment  are  e pluribus unum  latin for  out of many  one   this was the de facto motto of the united states before  in god we trust  was enacted in       virtue  liberty and independence  this is pennsylvania s official motto  the resolution can be found here  the p g  this morning  thinks this resolution is a bad idea  to be sure   in god we trust  has been the nation s motto since      and there s no suggestion that it be stricken from the currency or otherwise banished  but to introduce it now in an age much more pluralistic is to invite discord  americans understand well enough that while  in god we trust  seems inclusive of other monotheistic religions  its wellspring is the politically charged notion that this is a  christian nation   and the offense to those who will object is not mitigated by hiding the religious message among the clutter of other slogans  sometimes the best slogan is  leave well enough alone   the ffrf has entered the story  the allegheny county council in pittsburgh  pa   will vote on sept    on whether to post a plaque declaring  in god we trust  in the gold room of the county courthouse  this proposal is the brainchild of state rep  rick saccone  who wants the motto to appear in public buildings  including schools  throughout the commonwealth of pennsylvania  ffrf filed a previous suit challenging saccone when he declared to the pennsylvania house that      was  the year of the bible   the proposal is sponsored by councilwoman sue means  who insists that the motto is  patriotic   thereby inappropriately suggesting a religious litmus test for good citizenship  ah  rick saccone  remember him  he wanted to pass a law stating that      was  for pennsylvania  the year of the bible  he also thinks waterboarding s a grand idea  so now we know with what we are dealing  all that being said  my question here is   who are they referencing in the motto  in god we trust    for whom  exactly  does the motto speak  all the citizens of allegheny county  allegheny county council  the individual members of the council who sponsored the resolution  let s take it one at a time  in a recent report out of trinity college in hartford  ct states  one of the most widely noted findings from the american religious identification survey  aris        which was released in march       was the substantial increase in the no religion segment of the u s  population  whom we designate as  nones   the nones increased from      of the u s  adult population in      to     in      and from    to    million adults  their numbers far exceed the combined total of all the non christian religious groups in the u s  who exactly are the nones   none  is not a movement  but a label for a diverse group of people who do not identify with any of the myriad of religious options in the american religious marketplace   the irreligious  the unreligious  the anti religious  and the anti clerical  some believe in god  some do not  some may participate occasionally in religious rituals  others never will  nones are easily misunderstood  on the one hand  only a small minority are atheists  on the other hand  it is also not correct to describe them as  unchurched  or  unaffiliated  on the assumption that they are mainly theists and religious searchers who are temporarily between congregations  yet another incorrect assumption is that large proportions of nones are anti rationalist proponents of new age and supernatural ideas  as we will show  they are more likely to be rational skeptics  so what are the numbers involved here  the above says that report estimates that     of the population are  nones   on page    of the report  it says that     of that     is either  atheist   hard agnostic  or  soft agnostic   defined as  there is no such thing  as god     there is no way to know  if there is a god    or  i m not sure  if there is a god    respectively   page    of the report says that pennsylvania is about in line with the percentage of  nones  in the state compared to the overall united states        if we can extrapolate  that means that there s a pretty good chance that a little more than           of      of pennsylvanians do not hold the belief that there is a god  they either know there isn t or aren t sure there is   if the population of allegheny county is      million and the percentage of      of non theists holds true  then about seventy seven thousand allegheny county citizens simply aren t represented in the  we  of  in god we trust   that s more than would fit into heinz field  in fact it s about double the number of people who would fit in pnc park  so it can t be representative of all of allegheny county  can it  and yet it s to be nailed to the wall of the county s legislative body  so is it just the council  but then why attach it to the wall for all citizens to see  for the non theists of the county  and i count myself as one of them  would we be truly welcome as a full citizen in council chambers  remember the state constitution says  all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship almighty god according to the dictates of their own consciences  no man can of right be compelled to attend  erect or support any place of worship or to maintain any ministry against his consent  no human authority can  in any case whatever  control or interfere with the rights of conscience  and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship   emphasis added   tell me again how declaring  in god we trust  doesn t interfere with a non believer s right to conscience  update from sue  over at pghlesbian com  stop focusing on signage and instead focus on being people of good conscience who act according to their personal values   practice christianity all you want  feed the hungry  heal the sick  answer your email  etc  but please stop imposing christianity on your non christian constituents simply because they are a numerical minority  that is wrong  yes  it is \n",

            "Debug Text -  this one  i think  and i say  i think  only because in the letter  see below for the text   the senator is giving a response about trump s executive orders regarding immigration and the first letter i sent him is the only one that even mentions immigration  i ll let you be the judge as to whether senator pat toomey is answering any of my questions  first let me offer up some background  in unlikely event you hadn t already heard  there s been an ongoing protest against pennsylvania senator pat toomey s seeming reluctance to meet with his constituents  there s a facebook page  and a twitter page  as the group s name implies  every tuesday a group of people can be expected to protest outside of each of his offices statewide  i thought it such a good idea  i started my own  tuesdays with toomey  project at this blog   hence my open letters to pennsylvania s junior senator  and one of my two senatorial representatives in the us congress  pat toomey  i ve sent senator toomey eight letters so far and this is the first response i ve received  here s what i wrote two months ago  recently on  face the nation  senior white house policy adviser stephen miller had this exchange with host john dickerson  when asked whether the administration had  learned anything  from their experience with the immigration executive order  he replied  well  i think that it s been an important reminder to all americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many case a supreme branch of government  one unelected judge in seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country  i mean this is just crazy  john  the idea that you have a judge in seattle say that a foreign national living in libya has an effective right to enter the united states is    is    is beyond anything we ve ever seen before  the end result of this  though  is that our opponents  the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions  that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned   emphasis added   senator  do you think he s correct  given the fact that our constitution defines three equal branches of government does the president have unquestionable power when it comes to national defense  or do you believe that there is judicial and legislative oversight that serves as a check and balance to the president s authority  whatever it is  and this is how senator toomey responded with the letter is dated march           full text at the bottom of this post   so  let s take a closer look at what he does say  shall we  you ll notice in my blog post that i wasn t actually asking about trump s executive order  rather  i was asking whether  in our constitutionally described checks and balances system of government  toomey agreed with trump advisor steven miller when the latter said that trump s power to defend the nation  will not be questioned   the immigration angle was tangential  there s an old saying in washington  never answer the question that is asked of you  answer the question that you wish had been asked of you  and i suppose that s what toomey s doing here   he doesn t want to address the issue i raised so he ll simply ignore it and talk about something else  in any event  toomey s talking about executive order         which he says lays out a  sensible rationale  for banning the entry of individuals to the u s  from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria  and yemen  he says that the executive order does not set forth a religious test which is interesting  since the letter is dated about two weeks after a federal judge in hawaii ruled  the court turns to whether plaintiffs sufficiently establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their count i claim that the executive order violates the establishment clause of the first amendment  because a reasonable  objective observer enlightened by the specific historical context  contemporaneous public statements  and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion  in spite of its stated  religiously neutral purpose  the court finds that plaintiffs  and dr  elshikh in particular  are likely to succeed on the merits of their establishment clause claim  which is to say  of course  that it is a muslim ban  it does set forth a religious test  it s interesting that senator toomey doesn t even mention the ruling in hawaii   even if only to disagree with it  indeed  reading his letter one is not sure whether the senator even knows that the implementation of the executive order has even been banned nationwide  he writes  so if you didn t already know that the executive order has been blocked by a federal judge you wouldn t know it from toomey s letter to one of his constituents  why not  isn t that troubling  isn t it troubling that a u s  senator  who s avoiding town hall meetings with his constituents  will avoid a question posed to him about the integrity of our constitutional republic and in its place offer an answer that s a misleading picture of our political reality  i just wonder what toomey s next letter to me will say  full text of toomey s letter below  dear david  thank you for contacting me about president trump s executive order concerning entry of certain foreign nationals to the u s  i appreciate hearing from you  on march           president trump rescinded a prior immigration executive order and issued a revised one concerning the entry of certain foreign nationals from six countries into the u s  the president laid out a sensible rationale for covering each nation  explain how these states fail to provide the information we need to vet their residents for terror ties  president trump s executive order does not set forth a religious test  it sets forth a national security test to protect the american people  the executive order also specifies that any nation can remove itself from the list by sharing information on terrorists with the united states  in this way  the new executive order is similar to the american safe act  which i and a bipartisan majority of the house and senate supported last congress  furthermore  i was pleased to see that president trump took into account concerns i raised that the previous order did not strike the right balance between defending our people against the deadly threat of international terrorism and providing a safe haven for innocent refugees seeking peace and freedom  for instance  the new order wisely clarifies that green card holders and those who were granted visas for assisting our military will be able to enter the u s  while i am still reviewing the details of the revised executive order and will closely monitor its implementation  it appears to lay out a more detailed  coordinated and clearer set of rules that will hopefully yield less confusion about who can and cannot enter the country  thank you again for your correspondence  i value knowing your input on this important issue  please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if i can be of assistance  sincerely pat toomey u s  senator\n",

            "Debug Text -  yesterday  kdka radio s wendy bell tweeted  listening to president s daily press briefing  i ve come to one conclusion  jonathan karl from abc news is a self aggrandizing hack    wendy bell    april          um  so what happened with jonathan karl on april     admiral giroir had just responded to a question about coronavirus testing with some very healthy numbers  that s when jonathon karl asked this  but we sat here in the rose garden  back on march     and these companies were here  some other companies were here  by my count  only    drive through test sites have been set up by the companies that were here  i m wondering if you   and  of course  mr  vice president  back in early march  you said we d be at   million tests by the following week  we re just now got there in the last few days  so what have you learned about what went wrong  you know  a month and a half   or over the last month and a half or two months  for the record  there are    days between march    and april     and this is how vice president pence responded  jon  i appreciate the question  but it represents a misunderstanding on your part and the   and frankly  the   a lot of people in the public s part about the difference between having a test versus the ability to actually process the test   emphasis added   what    let s go back to the march briefing where the   million tests thing was floated and actually it s march    so i guess that proves bell is right   jonathan karl is a hack     pence says  we also met today in a conference call with    of america s governors  we were able to brief them on the latest   the progress that we ve made  we were able to confirm with them that testing is now available in all state labs in every state in the country  over a million tests have been distributed  before the end of this week  another   million tests will be distributed  but as i said before  with the deployment of the commercial labs  we literally   we literally are going to see a dramatic increase in the available   availability of testing  and that s all a direct result of the president s leadership  this is the context surrounding karl s question of april     and  by extension  wendy bell s pronouncement of karl s hackitude   so allow me to paraphrase  karl  with the understanding that these would be processed tests  said that the administration had promised   million tests per week  to which trump booster pence responded by pointing out that when he said what he said he only meant that there d be   million available tests  as cnn s daniel dale points out  this is a lie by omission  vice president mike pence claimed on monday that much of the american public has a  misunderstanding  of his march   claim that   million coronavirus tests would be distributed by the end of that week  pence was doing again on monday what he had done on march   and has done regularly since  leaving out a critical piece of information  this time  he failed to explain that it had been his own words that created the  misunderstanding     instead laying the confusion at the feet of the media and average citizens  pence s comments on the subject of testing  including the remarks he was asked about on monday  have consistently painted a picture that is far rosier than the actual situation on the ground  unlike president donald trump  pence has not been flat lying  rather  he has misled by omission  adding  if pence had wanted to make clear on march   that he did not mean   million people could actually get tested fast  he could have said so  instead  he conveniently omitted it  a lie of omission  elsewhere in the briefing  pence announces  and let me ask the secretary of hhs to give us the latest on the availability of testing to the american public and at the states  secretary azar frames his remarks with  great  thank you  mr  vice president  so we continue with our strategic plan at hhs  across all of the components represented by many of the leaders here  which is to diagnose  to treat  to contain  to mitigate  to research  and communicate  it s what we do in a healthcare crisis situation  and then finally gets to  we  by the end of this week  expect to be able to be producing up to   million tests per week in the united states  note how even secretary azar s used the verb  producing  in his remarks   so the lie isn t just pence  azar knew what they were doing as well  so jonathan karl stumbles into a huge lie of omission by the trump administration and instead of pointing out the dishonesty  kdka radio s wendy bell dutifully calls abc s jonathan karl a  hack  instead  but then again  this is the human being who is  on a fence  about whether it s a good idea keep the economy locked down  for less than one percent of our population  many of whom are already ill  or aged   wendy bell is a vile cruel person  maybe someday she can call me a hack in public  wendy  with        dead so far  a crisis made much worse by the actions and inactions of donald j  trump  it would be a badge of honor  snowflake  a badge of honor \n",
